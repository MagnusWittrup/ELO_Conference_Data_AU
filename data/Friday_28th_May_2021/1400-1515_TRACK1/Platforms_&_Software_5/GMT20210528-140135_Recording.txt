00:33:05	Jeremy Hight:	I had an absurd publishing house imagined as behind the timeline in a smelly office on facebook...published ebooks by mark marino and others then facebook broke the form with no notice on my account  but twitter has left alone my one word a day book
00:34:15	Alessia Pannese:	Thank you
00:34:46	Jeremy Hight:	ecosystem is a great metaphor  and facebook has been called a walled garden
00:35:10	Caitlin Fisher:	Old school!

00:54:46	Alessia Pannese:	thank you 
00:55:03	Jeremy Hight:	taught Erik's work when I taught at uc sn diego….so brilliant to see form open to metadata  and back
01:03:17	Alessia Pannese:	thank you
01:05:44	Alan Sondheim:	apologies, have to go -
01:05:53	Lai-Tze Fan:	Thanks for coming, Alan!
01:05:54	Caitlin Fisher:	bye, Alan!
01:06:29	Jeremy Hight:	semiotically and semantically ..narrative has a shifting resonance and is more porous than the general concept as defined.....would love to hear how each of you are inspired by the play around the paradigm
01:07:05	Lai-Tze Fan:	Jeremy is next~
01:07:40	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	I’ve dreamt about spreadsheets lately…
01:08:03	Jeremy Hight:	I swam in one of Erik's early works once in a dream
01:08:27	Nick Montfort:	The e-lit effect rather than the Tetris effect
01:08:47	Erik Loyer:	Someone must have done research on Tetris dreams by now...
01:10:25	Nick Montfort:	Maybe we could divide the content and form into a data fork and a resource fork...
01:10:34	Lai-Tze Fan:	Jeremy, then Caitlin (unless Caitlin is trying to respond instead of ask a Q?)
01:10:41	Nick Montfort:	(Joke for those at the HyperCard panel)
01:10:50	Caitlin Fisher:	Responding… if that’s ok?
01:10:59	Lai-Tze Fan:	Yes, of course!
01:11:03	John McDaid:	@nick only if the disk spins at variable speed…
01:14:23	Caitlin Fisher:	Big Mood: “destroyed. again”
01:14:39	Erik Loyer:	+1
01:17:30	Scott Rettberg:	I have another comment if there’s time.
01:17:38	Jeremy Hight:	it is interesting that back at calarts    narrative in animation was taught as something moves or changes.....yet in undergrad English courses was of the greek tragedies etc
01:17:57	Lai-Tze Fan:	Sure. I’ll go after (can’t find hand raising button).
01:18:36	Caitlin Fisher:	great project
01:19:54	Caitlin Fisher:	One thing I love about unity is the pipeline to both VR and AR….  Such different ways to experience the same work… changes it in profound ways. Also fun ;)
01:20:28	Caitlin Fisher:	great comment, Scott
01:22:21	Jeremy Hight:	lev owes me a taco from 2005
01:22:37	rodcoover:	I agree with Scott. The experience with Hearts and some of the other projects we did is how different narrative becomes in moving between a readerly, private environment versus a performance, storytelling environment that is shared, but also when it goes form a virtual experience taking place on the material object of a personal computer versus the reinhabiting and transforming existing material spaces like planetariums or cinemas. Mapping on differing social spaces turns back upon  narrative forms too.
01:25:18	Caitlin Fisher:	Lev owes us all tacos.
01:25:33	Jeremy Hight:	indeed
01:26:28	Nick Montfort:	Thank you all!
