12
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.740
Marjorie Luesebrink: At the Vancouver conference and.

13

Marjorie Luesebrink: Since then we have.

14
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:15.120
Marjorie Luesebrink: With us veterans that have been at all the panels and over the years, many other new people joining and and contributing and then and then this year, we have our veterans and.

15
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.900
Christy Sanford: New people.

16
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.670
Marjorie Luesebrink: As well and.

17
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.150
Marjorie Luesebrink: We have been over the years, exploring many of the ideas that come up around specific.

18
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.610
Marjorie Luesebrink: Issues of narrative both fiction and nonfiction in the literature.

19
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.030
Marjorie Luesebrink: The narrative gang.

20
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.890
Marjorie Luesebrink: Today we'll be looking at how platforms.

21
00:02:48.990 --> 00:03:09.420
Marjorie Luesebrink: Either effect or in fact in you know enhance our ability to tell narratives we started out last year actually thinking about connections and disconnections as a way of exploring exactly what happens to narrative.

22
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:21.030
Marjorie Luesebrink: In the platform situation and other words, how do we enter and exit and what does that do to narrative in terms of our relationship to our audience.

23
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.080
Marjorie Luesebrink: And among the people that are here today, we have a.

24
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.870
Marjorie Luesebrink: An amazing range of people who have used every almost every software.

25
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:53.220
Marjorie Luesebrink: And every platform that I can think of from for the last 30 years in fact I started making a list and I thought well that'll take all of our all of our time, so I will just say that you know we have we have gone from.

26
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:07.260
Marjorie Luesebrink: floppy disk to augmented reality we've gone from html and blogs to telephone opera opera we've gone from a.

27
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:19.740
Marjorie Luesebrink: From the most primitive of stories face software, all the way to iPad Apps and beyond.

28
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.920
Marjorie Luesebrink: Eric lawyer Christie Sheffield sanford will lose.

29
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.610
Marjorie Luesebrink: caitlin Fisher and light she fan will be giving will be sharing their experience with these platforms.

30
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:45.420
Marjorie Luesebrink: And the work that they're they're doing and then because this conference has actually opened up a whole new world of discussion.

31
00:04:45.900 --> 00:05:05.850
Marjorie Luesebrink: About platform and platform possibility, I hope that we can bring some of that to our discussion today, because we will have a good long time to talk about the things that have come onto the scene in the last few days, I also want to give a shout out to.

32
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:16.230
Marjorie Luesebrink: Scott and soren and all of the people that contributed to this incredible conference, this has been amazing I have loved every minute.

33
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:35.010
Marjorie Luesebrink: And I cannot believe how beautifully it's been organized and how wonderful it's been to have you all here so with without any further ado i'm going to turn this back over to lie cheat and I will be here as respondent to help ask questions and.

34
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.060
Marjorie Luesebrink: move things along and in the discussion when we get to that, so thank you all for being here.

35
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.260
Lai-Tze Fan: thanks for that Margie and.

36
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:57.630
Lai-Tze Fan: So we have several speakers today and we didn't think we were thinking about the panel as more of a lightning talks plus discussion.

37
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.390
Lai-Tze Fan: So there isn't a particular order that we'd agreed to do someone wants to go first and they would they just like to get it over with.

38
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:22.650
Christy Sanford: Oh sure, thank you, and thanks yellow and the Panel for the chance to talk about electronic literature and the effect platforms have on narrative.

39
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:32.130
Christy Sanford: A start out with two little short parts and then give you a little slideshow ode to daring you just have to get crazier.

40
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.640
Christy Sanford: And that's a quote from pina Bausch to one of her dancers, after 20 years that was the only thing she ever said to her.

41
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:57.990
Christy Sanford: In general, presenting my work online has resulted in narratives that are shorter often interrupted increasingly paired with images and filled with connections, the Web metaphor is still strong and makes deep time multiple associations and aggressions the norm.

42
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:09.300
Christy Sanford: My animations on vimeo or YouTube or not so impacted by those platforms as by the supporting platforms like keynote Max answer to PowerPoint.

43
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:22.500
Christy Sanford: And I movie an MP4 mini keynote effects designed for texts can dramatically impact how narratives are conceived and presented in book form or literary sites.

44
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:31.590
Christy Sanford: After working with animation have increasingly turned to capturing presenting text in motion and letting images control the text.

45
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:42.510
Christy Sanford: I love the visual the source idea linking words in space layers reveal how space imparts narrative, especially in poetry and lyrical essays.

46
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:53.880
Christy Sanford: Many feel emphasizing space in poetry threatens sound and rhythm as primary, but I think spatial and temporal awareness can coexist.

47
00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.870
Christy Sanford: And the little second section is blow it up this concept is analogous to burning down the House.

48
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:09.840
Christy Sanford: destruction is central to distilling essence shedding boring or dead ideas and capturing decades vitality.

49
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:29.400
Christy Sanford: keynote transition effects are powerful words can fly from the scene at random an image can be set a flame races flip flop fall down the page i'm often avoid you're catching text and image and some intriguing act creating tension or new associations, I wouldn't have otherwise envisioned.

50
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:50.610
Christy Sanford: Years ago, after Joel lippmann read his point stamped on an old paperback page he crumbled it this unforgettable performance made me reflect on the sanctity of books and the transient nature of life, the Japanese have a phrase Mano know where a bitter sweet sensitivity to impermanence.

51
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.010
Christy Sanford: And now we're going to do a little screen share.

52
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:57.900
Christy Sanford: and

53
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.910
Christy Sanford: Close some some windows so don't look too messy.

54
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:32.280
Christy Sanford: Okay, these are excerpts from the manuscript in progress, called states of fandom and frenzy, which may become a doorway book that's opposed, as opposed to a flip book.

55
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:49.170
Christy Sanford: fans and kimonos symbols of Japanese MMA were popular among late 19th century artists and poets Mel or may wrote 18 points on fans and gave them to women, he admired this one to his daughter, I put underwater.

56
00:09:52.200 --> 00:10:13.470
Christy Sanford: The complaint which is one section for my collection concerned concerns at 2015 scandal at Boston museum of fine arts as owner of monet's like Japanese a portrait of clods wife Camille the museum hosted kimono wednesday's art lovers donned a replica and pose before the painting.

57
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:25.470
Christy Sanford: irate protesters appeared carrying signs exoticism racism appropriation imperialism and murder.

58
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:49.440
Christy Sanford: To meditate on Monet and cultural appropriation I manipulated 1600s kimonos from Boston museums book collection, I wrote about Claude Camille and Japanese my and made my own images which I also wrote about creating a reflexive expressed stick form.

59
00:10:52.410 --> 00:11:01.380
Christy Sanford: On this origami airplane pattern artists models chat evaluating how they work betrayed if they got paid, etc.

60
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:16.770
Christy Sanford: Worrying my kimonos for becoming too pretty I crumbled an image and keynote took a screen grab and return the wrecked komodo to the project Japanese characters for beautiful woman span the ropes border.

61
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:26.940
Christy Sanford: researching the history of Japan and France and Japan and the US, I found Commodore Matthew perry's.

62
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:45.780
Christy Sanford: demands to open Japanese ports on the left as a partial list of gifts, we gave Japan to speed capitulation the tree is from a Monet landscape, the image on the right is a totally blown apart come on oh my favorite collection.

63
00:11:47.100 --> 00:12:05.490
Christy Sanford: Working in book mode side by page with pages, side by side, creates an awareness of potential conversations and lines of connection between the two pages truncated text tend to shift the gays bringing different passages into focus, promoting multiple readings.

64
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:21.450
Christy Sanford: comment or periods demands continued on the ride is a tornado cloud from NASA and commentary about an idea of working in a series that Monet likely adopted from Japanese wood blocks.

65
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:34.020
Christy Sanford: If an artist paints a landscape, a scene of Parliament week fail, a locomotive moving out of the station at various times of the day and year the image will change.

66
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:49.080
Christy Sanford: On the right the rectangular boxes gave me a satori the komodo abstracted is T shaped the first text is a Monet letter X or.

67
00:12:49.890 --> 00:13:05.610
Christy Sanford: painting on plan air in Norway, you described his beard hanging from his face likes to like tights below that he praises Japanese artists ability to evoke presence by the shadow, and the whole by apart.

68
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:14.850
Christy Sanford: The kimono on the left, contains samurai warrior portraits in a snowstorm and of course I manipulated that.

69
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:29.910
Christy Sanford: platforms and programs often encouraged spatial awareness i'm intrigued by what I call the constellation form which, like stars in the sky can be comprehended all at once.

70
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:31.920
Christy Sanford: And so that.

71
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.140
Christy Sanford: Is my.

72
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.490
Christy Sanford: my presentation.

73
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.090
Christy Sanford: And if I can get out there.

74
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.140
Lai-Tze Fan: Thank you, Chris yes beautiful so many beautiful image I.

75
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.300
Lai-Tze Fan: want to point out some of those kimonos into life size, I can wear them.

76
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.870
Lai-Tze Fan: Who would like to go next.

77
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.160
Will Luers: we'll go lie cheat.

78
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.990
Lai-Tze Fan: So who is, as I will.

79
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.740
Will Luers: feel sorry.

80
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.340
yeah.

81
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:12.690
Will Luers: Good morning, I am I pre recorded my talk to keep the five minute mark if that's okay.

82
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.960
Lai-Tze Fan: Very considered.

83
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.470
Will Luers: Just a second here.

84
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.750
Will Luers: So platforms tools and vernacular imaginary i'll just go ahead and start it.

85
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:43.350
Will Luers: Can there be something like a digital folk that remains tethered to the platform and platforms and tools of global networks.

86
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:50.550
Will Luers: folklore is the term that defines types of human expression that are outside domains of commercial public and religious institutions.

87
00:14:51.150 --> 00:15:01.590
Will Luers: The disappearance of a digital frog leaves behind a distributed vernacular that is driven by rapid technological innovation made by complex powerful and mostly non human entities.

88
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:13.050
Will Luers: Material expression online is certainly woven with the beliefs symbols and stories offline but the unique of computer give rise to an emergent digital imaginary.

89
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:22.290
Will Luers: or shared framework made up motifs and archetypes for the network to imaginations play it in his recent digital imaginary rod recovered.

90
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:32.340
Will Luers: brings together a variety of voices mostly Isla creators to discuss how computers are transforming ways of imagining the world and making stories about it.

91
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.550
Will Luers: Many works of fiction do not follow easy pat easy pass in this construction.

92
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:52.500
Will Luers: and imagine world of work, like cry presents an interface to traumatize mind mental processes are arranged as parallel story fragments navigation, that of course Cinematic montage and interface abstractions.

93
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.440
Will Luers: A large part of the digital imaginary is around this shared experience of interacting with screen.

94
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:06.090
Will Luers: Only a Lena Lena playfully refers to the early web attempts to personal html expression as a digital folklore.

95
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:18.510
Will Luers: In the 1990s, the web, was the platform and html was the tool, the elena's own innovative digital art as within that art movement in general, was made in the context of this emerging web folk culture.

96
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:27.750
Will Luers: vernacular by default, the early web was a digital imaginary made of half finished homepages alien looking code broken links and error messages.

97
00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:42.720
Will Luers: But as Lena Lena makes clear in her writing and curating the early web the digital folk no longer exist because current social media interfaces professionalize the vernacular and post systems of uniform design and algorithm evaluation.

98
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:53.670
Will Luers: It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between digital expression that is vernacular and works and digital art, because both are on the same platforms and often use the same techniques.

99
00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:02.940
Will Luers: Because, perhaps because of this neo Flores and others have champion greater inclusive city and what academics and curators called electronic literature.

100
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:10.980
Will Luers: As an example of this new popular digital writing florists presents the viral video lazy cat by tech stories.

101
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:22.200
Will Luers: lazy cat and extended on one line joke evokes a uniquely digital imaginary who exactly are we texting to and what are they doing at the moment we are texting.

102
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.930
Will Luers: The work is a time based multimodal representation of a disembodied semiotic experience.

103
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:36.840
Will Luers: Similarly Allen bigelow's how to rob a bank uses a familiar first person perspective on mobile interfaces to narrate the story of frantic network desire.

104
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:49.170
Will Luers: A greater inclusive, it will make creators and academics, see the important synergy between ambitious digital art and popular vernacular forms but hopefully not to the diminishment of the former.

105
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:55.050
Will Luers: To critique of third generation Isla is often directed at the social media companies themselves.

106
00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:04.560
Will Luers: Many of the most popular platforms to store and exploit vernacular digital culture by squeezing all expression into the algorithmically curated conveyor belt of content.

107
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:23.850
Will Luers: Really Torres and Daniel to selling in there in defense of the difficult Warren have a true easy acceptance of this non human memorization of human languages based site for the Rico companion book technique technique and magic which is with his critique.

108
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:34.200
Will Luers: Of the absolute instrumentality of technic as a form of therapy to two techniques of brutal regime companion proposes an alternative.

109
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:48.330
Will Luers: and very old reality system that proceeds from the ineffable rather than from absolute certainty magic is a symbolic language that in no way attempts to fully convey and exhaust the object of his signature of its significations quote Unquote.

110
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:58.260
Will Luers: The digital imaginary is where the forces of these two systems technique and technique and magic play out in network life.

111
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.840
Will Luers: tourists and to Sally defending the difficult in digital art and writing against popular forms right.

112
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:17.070
Will Luers: A literature should perhaps some system critical digital literacy is placing the reader in situations of loss unsettling making foundations falter turning our relationship relationships with language into crisis.

113
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.690
Will Luers: On a knocker some someone's an image for a practical approach to the issues and inclusive it in the face of technique.

114
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:38.490
Will Luers: The wild garden instead of killing off what appears at first to be pest needs to permaculture gardener allows a variety of organisms to flourish turning enemies into unexpected allies on the way to a richer and more resilient ecosystem.

115
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.970
Will Luers: companion proposes a similar metaphor for how human culture can stay in balance with the technical regime.

116
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:51.000
Will Luers: In Renaissance, Italy, it was common for wealthy homes to have a garden for both food and philosophical contemplation.

117
00:19:51.570 --> 00:20:04.470
Will Luers: A manager cosmos that was part of that fruit and vegetable farm part rational geometric design and a final part quote the Bosco which was left in a state of wilderness daunted by statues of pagan gods.

118
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:15.030
Will Luers: Making space for wildness in a man made environment is an F is an effective even rational method for maintaining healthy ecosystems and human cultures.

119
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.780
Will Luers: In practical terms, for the healthy future of electronic literature for all digital art that probes digital imaginary.

120
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:32.460
Will Luers: And for a human culture at large, for the human culture at large, we should demand that our platforms tools and institutions, welcome the inevitable wildness at the Center of human existence.

121
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.270
Will Luers: Thank you.

122
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:37.980
Marjorie Luesebrink: wow.

123
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.490
Lai-Tze Fan: hi I really enjoy.

124
00:20:48.660 --> 00:21:04.530
Lai-Tze Fan: The metaphor of the garden, and thank you for bringing my attention back to an essay which I believe was also in conversation with something that Kathy in barron's wrote for er so if people want to check that out, you also mentioned leo's essay which also appears in EBS.

125
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.030
Will Luers: Yes, I.

126
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.610
Will Luers: I did come up, I mean Nick is also part of my paper and I didn't I had to cut to you sorry Nick.

127
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.020
Will Luers: that's.

128
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.750
Lai-Tze Fan: that's Okay, because i'm going to talk about Nick now for five minutes.

129
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:27.630
Lai-Tze Fan: I guess all I guess that's a natural entryway into what I have to say okay so um the paper, I wrote for this panel.

130
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.870
Lai-Tze Fan: site me back, maybe because I wrote it on paper and it pleaded with me.

131
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:46.620
Lai-Tze Fan: Again, or pleaded against as a becoming an Ms Ms document, and then a PDF and I don't think we'll ever wanted to be constricted to any of those platforms so.

132
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.410
Lai-Tze Fan: Even as it settled into a PDF format I finally listened to.

133
00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:02.370
Lai-Tze Fan: What I wanted and why does it become a hypertext so this paper was born to be a hypertext I was writing a book Chapter four forthcoming edited collection on space and elan's.

134
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:14.340
Lai-Tze Fan: And I wanted to trace a work of 11 from its content to its interface from its interface to its data from his data to its hardware from its hardware.

135
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.850
Lai-Tze Fan: To is computational components to its raw materials to its origins on earth.

136
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:32.940
Lai-Tze Fan: OK, so the very unseen hands the dug it out of the ground or we refined it's like a way scraps to be inserted back into the production trick chain, and it was a lot.

137
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:45.420
Lai-Tze Fan: The big chapter, but in the idea of talking about it today once again in this linear form know the paper five back so now it's a hypertext the aesthetics, of which i'm not entirely.

138
00:22:46.380 --> 00:23:00.150
Lai-Tze Fan: happy with yet, but i'm happy to share the beta versions with you, so please see the link in the chat for from silicon from screen to silicon or you can follow along on my screen so first what i'll say is.

139
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.230
Lai-Tze Fan: We it, I wrote it in twine so.

140
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:16.800
Lai-Tze Fan: Right now, it looks like this, and if this if the structure looks slightly familiar, I can explain.

141
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.000
Lai-Tze Fan: Some of my inspirations and making it look this way but.

142
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.540
Lai-Tze Fan: What i'll do is.

143
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.470
Lai-Tze Fan: lay the story from the beginning.

144
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:42.510
Lai-Tze Fan: hey so right, this is called from screen to silicon reverse engineering the computational infrastructure of Nick markers round.

145
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:57.060
Lai-Tze Fan: Again, a beta version, and if you want the work cited, you can find them here for the long the full the full work think my computer is struggling because so many things are happening so yeah i'll just.

146
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.880
Lai-Tze Fan: So you can click at your own pace or follow along and.

147
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.250
Lai-Tze Fan: i'm going to go full screen.

148
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:19.350
Lai-Tze Fan: Tell me, where in the world did devices come from how and by whom are they produced what happens to them when they are no longer of cultural value to us.

149
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.410
Lai-Tze Fan: Why should I care, and so I.

150
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:37.770
Lai-Tze Fan: As I said, I focused on one work and make my first round, and the story starts to some questions that consumers may ask about their digital devices life cycles, a topic I spoke about it.

151
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:58.530
Lai-Tze Fan: In Montreal, but perhaps they won't ask, in which case they can click this and this question why should I care, and I can explain to them what i'm doing in the works i'm inspired by including an K crawford's anatomy of an Ai so this starts, you know what the.

152
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.980
Lai-Tze Fan: I can't see the screen so i'm going to have to not full screen and apologies, I hope, people can still read this.

153
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:13.770
Lai-Tze Fan: When you're engaging with the digital device whether pressing keys streaming a video or swiping through photographs the screen, is where the attention of most users stops.

154
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:26.010
Lai-Tze Fan: A user's undivided attention on the screen interfaces arguably the sole focus of many commercialized devices catalyzed by practices and black box design, which are used in many technological industries.

155
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.930
Lai-Tze Fan: And I think i'll let people read the rest on their own time I elaborate on that a little bit more.

156
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:40.860
Lai-Tze Fan: And this chapter explores how users can be encouraged to think about hardware operations that occur when using digital devices, as well as the material.

157
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:51.840
Lai-Tze Fan: The Labor the environmental processes of producing repurposing and disposing device hardware so i'm seeking to rethink the ways in which we think about imagine computational infrastructure.

158
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:58.560
Lai-Tze Fan: and especially troubling the classic capital circuit model production, distribution, consumption and.

159
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:12.180
Lai-Tze Fan: Re insert what happens before we should be excavation and what happens afterwards, which will be repurposed saying disposal and i'm drawing upon, as I mentioned K crawford's anatomy of an Ai system.

160
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:25.080
Lai-Tze Fan: which looks a little bit like the charts that I the the twine overview that i'd shown there's the Center of process and production in the middle, the what was familiar to the.

161
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.150
Lai-Tze Fan: To the user and then I think this is being cut off.

162
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.600
Lai-Tze Fan: But on the left, there would be the mining processes, the production processes among the afterward and then on the writing it's the.

163
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.920
Lai-Tze Fan: What happens with the device when you're done with it.

164
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:47.730
Lai-Tze Fan: So.

165
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.030
Lai-Tze Fan: Then I tell them a little bit about my methodology.

166
00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:02.970
Lai-Tze Fan: i'm using a it, similarly to K Crawford and also to Benjamin age Brighton i'm using this nonlinear storytelling approach.

167
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:10.200
Lai-Tze Fan: arguing that critical and creative storytelling about computational infrastructures can further understanding of these.

168
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:25.020
Lai-Tze Fan: processes and I try to compare try to pair them at the same time with a creative nonfiction narration of my own user experience with the device, so I nary narrated stages of my experience with the laptop.

169
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:36.570
Lai-Tze Fan: And my case study is make more friends generative computational power round was just described, some of the functions of its own operative heart software and hardware.

170
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:45.180
Lai-Tze Fan: And in choosing round I explicitly note that it is not the objective of morford nor has created a creative work to address.

171
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:56.730
Lai-Tze Fan: And, and that he's not in a position to blame for driver not addressing the exploitative aspects of techno capitalism that round through multiple associative steps ultimately points to.

172
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:11.100
Lai-Tze Fan: I choose round for its acute awareness of the relationship among screen content software and hardware and for its successes in ultimately drawing more attention to these relationships compared to other works that I could have examined.

173
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:22.380
Lai-Tze Fan: So here's where the narration starts in a different font i'm a meter in Toronto Canada i'm also a computer user sitting before a laptop that does not have.

174
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:32.280
Lai-Tze Fan: That does not have any programs running I offer my Internet browser and type in the URL to access make more offers generative poem round which is published, with new binary press.

175
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:43.410
Lai-Tze Fan: And now i've become a client to seeking a website hosted by the online publishing house new binary press with the IP address.

176
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.220
Lai-Tze Fan: found their IP address.

177
00:28:49.140 --> 00:29:00.810
Lai-Tze Fan: While the precedents editors are located in Cork Ireland the IP address reveals that new binary presses data and web servers hosted by eyes, can you black knight hosting are located at the Carlo Carlo.

178
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:08.700
Lai-Tze Fan: Data Center and Carlo Ireland, which is about 170 kilometers from Cork, so please feel free to click around because I should say that.

179
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:20.250
Lai-Tze Fan: laptop explains a purpose of writing this in the first place in person first person narration computer user jumps to the question of how my laptop was made fits like my literal.

180
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:31.140
Lai-Tze Fan: MAC book air laptop and so, if someone clicks computer user, for instance, they will meet other familiar questions that you may wonder.

181
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:37.080
Lai-Tze Fan: Would someone like to choose one for me to answer they're gonna they're going to load for a bit so.

182
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.070
Lai-Tze Fan: Anyone want to choose one something you've wondered.

183
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:56.490
Lai-Tze Fan: What are the what are other manufacturers and what and who's doing this Labor what elements to the materials come from where the refineries are process elements and who's doing this work where the mines, who the miners.

184
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.840
Lai-Tze Fan: No takers.

185
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.970
Marjorie Luesebrink: The call okay.

186
00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.370
Lai-Tze Fan: How about how about what elements.

187
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:21.360
Lai-Tze Fan: Okay i'm your answer depends on what materials you're looking for low is a list of the raw materials commonly found in the cpu the transistor the fan the heat sink, I chose these four computer components, because they're the main ones that are.

188
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:29.850
Lai-Tze Fan: mentioned and alluded to in in round so, for instance, if I choose silicon.

189
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.860
Lai-Tze Fan: As a user i'm I learned a little bit more about what's going on with my computer with its cpu.

190
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:49.710
Lai-Tze Fan: connections to it seek cpu components that are made out of silicone what is where what is silicone really where does it come from what what what, how is it processed.

191
00:30:51.390 --> 00:31:02.820
Lai-Tze Fan: And what are the implications of silica and after its process so, for instance in India, where there are 57 mining sites in the shanker drug.

192
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:15.600
Lai-Tze Fan: It region there have been there's been a lot of pollution and environmental there's a lot of environmental pollution that's connected to silica silica mining sites so.

193
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:27.660
Lai-Tze Fan: Alternatively, just kind of going backwards and if someone did not choose the oh I should maybe yeah I don't let this reload but.

194
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:39.510
Lai-Tze Fan: If somebody chooses to move forward with the text and reads reading on about my experience of round, they will.

195
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:41.610
Lai-Tze Fan: Perhaps.

196
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:54.210
Lai-Tze Fan: follow through with the narrative but at any point they can click off and the point is that, like similarly to Wikipedia and which i'm reading and having all these thoughts I don't always want to follow a linear path, I think this is why.

197
00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:00.750
Lai-Tze Fan: This worked in make sense as an acid it's never made sense as linear as a linear essay.

198
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:13.380
Lai-Tze Fan: So I can imagine the trajectory of the data as it moves from Cork to Carlo to me in Toronto, and the data is represented as a femoral content but it's not.

199
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:22.890
Lai-Tze Fan: necessarily a femoral right it's it relates it correlates to something very much material and when the website load successfully.

200
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:34.980
Lai-Tze Fan: The content is for the product, the product of calculations that are performed by my computer processor, if I click on this, I can read more about the computer processor, but then to explain what's happening i've.

201
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:44.820
Lai-Tze Fan: quoted nicking in notes on rounder kind of copying notes that he has, for the work, in which he explains that the work is.

202
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:53.760
Lai-Tze Fan: calculating digits of pi and it's code running a program that calculates those digits every time is loaded it's loading.

203
00:32:54.420 --> 00:33:08.520
Lai-Tze Fan: So in this case, I have no choice but to learn about the computer processor what it's doing the code that it's that the the scripts that it's drawing from and then learning about the computer processor.

204
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:21.930
Lai-Tze Fan: The text continues and around the 10 minute mark something starts to change in my laptop the words of the poem began to appear more.

205
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:34.560
Lai-Tze Fan: slowly and i'm suddenly a very aware that my laptop's fan, as it is right now, its volume begins to rise normally the fans really quiet, but at 12 minutes it's really loud.

206
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:44.160
Lai-Tze Fan: And I realized that if I were listening to music i'd have to increase the volume to endure in order to hear comfortably so as an experiment I run round again.

207
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.310
Lai-Tze Fan: While taking a video call and then at three minutes, it sounds like my computer is going to explode.

208
00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:03.060
Lai-Tze Fan: So it's an unavoidable loud and and I read monfort explanation of what's happening as round runs the production of texts will slow down more and more as.

209
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:17.280
Lai-Tze Fan: As more and more steps are necessary to determine the next digits of pi your computer will also slow down on other tasks and will physically heat up your computer fan of your computer's fan will work harder, as your processor labor's to complete these computations.

210
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:28.170
Lai-Tze Fan: And then, a little bit about fans and what they're trying to do the laptop band is going into overdrive but the safe temperature that is going for is 35 degrees.

211
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:35.760
Lai-Tze Fan: But it's if it reaches 80 to 200 degrees Celsius then your computer will shut down.

212
00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:48.840
Lai-Tze Fan: I think at this point, I mean it could I could keep going and going because I kind of talk about what would happen if your computer were to overheat if I were to keep running.

213
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:57.330
Lai-Tze Fan: Around essentially either, I have to close round or my computer will will close it for me, because it will not, it will have a.

214
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:11.400
Lai-Tze Fan: Theoretically burn itself out and then it must be replaced and then I examined, and if it if I broke my if I broke my laptop by reading round what happens to my computer.

215
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:21.030
Lai-Tze Fan: And i'm thinking a little bit about the recovery process of E waste, where it shipped in the world, so if, for instance, if it was shipped in East Asia.

216
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:31.230
Lai-Tze Fan: what's going on in the global sales with the processes of E waste recycling and ways in which is extremely toxic, what does that look like in Southeast Asia.

217
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:35.940
Lai-Tze Fan: South Asia.

218
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.970
Lai-Tze Fan: And then there's a longer process.

219
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.920
Lai-Tze Fan: there's a longer explanation about.

220
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:59.460
Lai-Tze Fan: harmful effects of E waste rights recycling in various parts of the world, so I think I as as as mentioned, you can click around because it's going to go on for a while, so i'm going to stop there, and let people just play with that thanks very much.

221
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.740
Marjorie Luesebrink: So Eric or caitlin.

222
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.780
Erik Loyer: I can jump in.

223
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:19.560
Marjorie Luesebrink: Thanks Eric.

224
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:34.590
Erik Loyer: Alright, so I don't have any slides will just be speaking today, thank you for being here thanks to yellow and for the panel organizers for making it possible, and looking forward to the discussion and what's been shown already has been fantastic.

225
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:46.920
Erik Loyer: So i'd like to start with a question i'd like you to think of a work of Isla that you are fond of maybe it's something that you've seen at this conference, maybe it's one of your own works, maybe it's something else entirely.

226
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:58.650
Erik Loyer: and start to consider that works content as distinct from its form start to separate the two in your mind and depending upon the work you're thinking of this may be easy or difficult or something in between.

227
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:07.770
Erik Loyer: It may seem impossible, but the question that i'd like to pose is what would it take to make that content, if you are able to kind of separate it in your mind.

228
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.780
Erik Loyer: publicly available in such a way that someone might want to restage it in a different form.

229
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:19.590
Erik Loyer: i'm sure many let pieces might contain text file or some kind of corpus that serves as its raw material.

230
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:26.610
Erik Loyer: But when we think about the score for a piece of music or a script for play it isn't just a file containing notes or lines of dialogue.

231
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:31.830
Erik Loyer: there's metadata and context embedded in it that tells us who is doing what, when and how.

232
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:41.550
Erik Loyer: And that additional context in a way, turns the script or the score into a kind of platform for human software based upon which multiple applications, ie performances can be run.

233
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:49.650
Erik Loyer: This ability to restage content, independent of form, is, I think a pretty vital aspect of human creative practice it from a technical standpoint.

234
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:55.290
Erik Loyer: doesn't actually work that well or happen that often when it comes to digital art and even digital entertainment.

235
00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:05.490
Erik Loyer: Content tends to live and die in the box that it came in and yet there are many he looks feel it works, whose content I would enjoy experiencing both inside and outside of the original packaging.

236
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:15.660
Erik Loyer: To a second question, should we try to make the content of digital art more like the script for a play or a musical score should we tried to make it easier to restage.

237
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:23.550
Erik Loyer: I first got interested in this line of thought, after years of working on digital projects with content that seemed to want to become platforms in this.

238
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:34.050
Erik Loyer: sense first of is the vectors journal, where we published experimental multimodal essays each one with its own custom data model that clearly separated the content and the structure of the essay from this form.

239
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:48.660
Erik Loyer: Then there were scale or scholarly publishing platform that integrates an API into every publication and API that can be used to query that application that publication structure, content and media, something that many skill or users, I think, may actually not be aware of.

240
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:54.030
Erik Loyer: Then, as I started getting into making interactive comics and the tools to build them.

241
00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:08.940
Erik Loyer: I started dreaming of finding a way to assemble and publish the metadata we were always just on the cusp of having metadata about which characters were in what panels, who was speaking when were various scenes were taking place and even what notes were being played in the musical score.

242
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.630
Erik Loyer: But the problem is it's extra effort to come up with this.

243
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.790
Erik Loyer: contextualizing metadata when you're in the middle of.

244
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:22.590
Erik Loyer: Creating a work and it's effort that may not be rewarded, because the practice of restaging content is not so widespread least in this technical sense.

245
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:29.640
Erik Loyer: So about five years ago, all this led me to make a personal commitment that any solo projects that I released would.

246
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.400
Erik Loyer: Both allow users to bring new content into the work.

247
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:40.380
Erik Loyer: and enable the works content to travel and be restaged elsewhere, and this really was the genesis of step works, the platform i've been developing since then.

248
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:55.650
Erik Loyer: On its surface that works is a tool for making simple event in the form of linear narratives with text media and musical timing, but unlike a typical media composition tool where you're manipulating isolated instances of those things at a bit of text here and image there.

249
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.810
Erik Loyer: And step works they're positioned as actions.

250
00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:02.610
Erik Loyer: taken by characters not unlike what you might find it a game engine or an Ai engine.

251
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:16.680
Erik Loyer: text doesn't just appear on the screen and spoken by someone or something a musical phrase isn't spontaneously sound it's played by a character on a specific instrument, and all this context is reflected in the data file step works creates which are simple json.

252
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:25.230
Erik Loyer: So, in a way, by default, anything you make with this application is already a kind of platform it's already a file describing who is doing what when.

253
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:34.230
Erik Loyer: That can be restaged any number of ways, and my hope is that, by showing some of the value of this practice that it might become more widespread that we might see more cases of.

254
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:42.960
Erik Loyer: Isla it works, where the content, both exists in its original form, but can also travel and be restaged in many different ways over longer periods of time.

255
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:59.850
Erik Loyer: So i'll end this with a another few questions to pose one if it was just as easy to create restage bull content for your projects as not to do it, would you do it, what concerns might you have about doing so and what possibilities might open up.

256
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:01.260
Thank you.

257
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.790
Lai-Tze Fan: Sir thought provoking questions and I love that you're dead directed them at the audience.

258
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.790
Lai-Tze Fan: caitlin would you like to you.

259
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:26.250
Caitlin Fisher: Sure, no that's great Thank you so much i'm loving this panel so much and Eric you've just made me think of something entirely different in like chief it was like the entire political economy narrative is part of platform and the anyway beautiful.

260
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.840
Caitlin Fisher: So.

261
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:40.380
Caitlin Fisher: margin lights, you were urging us to think about the way that we're bound to the tools we use, as well as enabled by them and to think about connections and disconnection so I was thinking that this is a female in a lot of my work.

262
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:58.950
Caitlin Fisher: As i'm sure it's the same for you when I first started using hypertext systems, I was really struck by the way to enabled certain kind of continuity as an expressive tool in my writing but also incredible discontinuity, at least at that time for novice readers of hypertext and traditional.

263
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:08.910
Caitlin Fisher: linear narratives so continuity just continuity divide was really urgent for me at that time and platform really enabled me to think.

264
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.050
Caitlin Fisher: About a lot of new things.

265
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:19.260
Caitlin Fisher: One of the things that really attracted me to electronic literature in the first place was at the platforms and tools had unique expressive capacities that made me write differently.

266
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:24.990
Caitlin Fisher: And I felt this, especially in those moments, where I was really stuck with pen on paper so like chairs thing about this when you were talking.

267
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:37.620
Caitlin Fisher: With my hands on the keyboard or in the word document constrained by those particular platforms so new kinds of tools enabled different forms of creativity and writing and a lot of weird joys and complications over the years.

268
00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:51.480
Caitlin Fisher: In those early days, at least, I always sort of coded and wrote fiction and poetry, at the same time and created the interface, so it really proceeded intuitively that's changed a bit over the years, as I kind of lost my comparative advantage in that.

269
00:42:52.020 --> 00:43:01.830
Caitlin Fisher: But that was always the the initial thing so and, yes, echoing Christie their changes in my writing in terms of granularity long form versus short form.

270
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:10.620
Caitlin Fisher: More moving image more voiceovers and later when writing inside game engines for vr more latency and nausea that were only accidentally part of the work.

271
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:21.330
Caitlin Fisher: Later moment for me and thinking through platforms were in the early days of my ar lab when we wanted to create narratives in augmented reality, but there were no tools available at that time.

272
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:29.910
Caitlin Fisher: That would enable us to do what we wanted to do, especially given that our lab was catering to writers and filmmakers and artists, often with little or no coding experience.

273
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:42.660
Caitlin Fisher: So we started to think about drag and drop tools and created our own storytelling software solution at that time called snap dragon ar so the process of thinking through what tool, the platform had to enable.

274
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.350
Caitlin Fisher: Anyway, really concrete is thinking through narrative and platform.

275
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:54.180
Caitlin Fisher: And thinking about the limits of our ability to make the ideal software package made really clear the ways in which users users are constraints are supported.

276
00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:03.270
Caitlin Fisher: From the moment of design and that this would impact the kind of words, they could write works, they could write, if not imagine some of the early drag and drop.

277
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:15.060
Caitlin Fisher: iterations of snapdragon ar were like one marker one movie we did a lot of moving image and so it enabled largely spatial storytelling but I was thinking a lot.

278
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:22.440
Caitlin Fisher: On the occasion of this panel about how we had the capacity and how it was far more interesting in terms of narrative to imagine that each marker.

279
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.940
Caitlin Fisher: That a marker could come into collision with other markers and create situations see.

280
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:40.110
Caitlin Fisher: In the difficulty was the computationally ended up we ended up crashing the systems a lot, it became more complex but, at the level of story that's really what we wanted, and a lot of the experiments in the lab we're about creating narratives using that kind of interface.

281
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:51.600
Caitlin Fisher: Thinking just about eric's What was really interesting about snapdragon is because it was really boutique II software, it was eventually sold, but in the early days it wasn't we always bundled our story.

282
00:44:52.110 --> 00:45:01.830
Caitlin Fisher: With the software and with markers or we just said print your own, and so we often had instructions for how you could set it up in your own living room and people broke them all the time.

283
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:13.260
Caitlin Fisher: So small handheld things that I would do would become like large things on people's bedrooms ceilings are you know how the story behave differently in people's hotel room, so I am totally into that Eric the idea that you create.

284
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:20.580
Caitlin Fisher: Enabling architectures for people and there's the stories that you send them can be broken.

285
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:36.570
Caitlin Fisher: Okay, let me just think another way, I wanted to think about platforms here beyond sort of imagining and building them is what we might be able to learn from translating works between them, so this has been a lot of what I do as I, as I.

286
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:45.750
Caitlin Fisher: Think about writing for different platforms, but i've often literally translated the same sort of narratives across platforms.

287
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:56.790
Caitlin Fisher: And this is particularly when I went from having sort of like room scale immersive environments to small handheld augmented reality creations and back again.

288
00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:05.940
Caitlin Fisher: So scale and proprioception thinking about the experience of reading and writing if you're thinking somebody is holding a story in their hands or whether they're immersed within it.

289
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:19.380
Caitlin Fisher: 1111 of the earlier narrative panels, I think, three years ago, maybe it was in Portugal, I remember talking about narrative and scale, so I don't want to belabor that here, but scale has been really, really fascinating and I just want to.

290
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:30.630
Caitlin Fisher: At least sort of signal that it has really changed my relationship to narrative when I think about scale, and that was something that I was never trained to do, and that has been largely accidental.

291
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:47.490
Caitlin Fisher: And that translating between large and small, taking the same small poem something like requiem that had been handheld and then walking through these stanzas as kind of like this inhabitable architecture has really made me rewrite and we think narrative.

292
00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:01.950
Caitlin Fisher: So I think of a platform and switching platforms and translation between platforms is as a way as a method, then, and as a strategy for understanding better understanding my work as a writer and the expressive capacities of different tools.

293
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.150
Caitlin Fisher: I guess one thing i'll just one other example just a concrete example of mine.

294
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:17.730
Caitlin Fisher: When I think about platforms is also 200 castles which was an earlier work and some of you may have seen it because it was exhibited at a low number of years ago.

295
00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:33.150
Caitlin Fisher: As a as a paper based work and but originally it was entirely it was a an APP designed for for iPad it was going to have a single tracker it was a story this sort of problem cystic story of like multiple.

296
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.000
Caitlin Fisher: Stories taking place in the.

297
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:45.630
Caitlin Fisher: In a castle and there was a one trigger kind of a sundial and a 3D model, the castle emerged and readers were going to.

298
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:57.060
Caitlin Fisher: Find hotspots on their screen and access, I think, at that point, they were about 25 lexi is and what I discovered really quickly is that nobody actually did that everybody who looked at the piece just.

299
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:07.320
Caitlin Fisher: brought up the 3D Castle, and sometimes walked around it so way to totally rethink the interface, but also the platform, because I recorded it so it wasn't an ios work.

300
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:12.480
Caitlin Fisher: I redid it and SAP dragon and and did it for print based work.

301
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:22.800
Caitlin Fisher: And what I realized with the platform change really was concession to existing literacy is realizing that it was really wasn't intelligible to people and was super broken if I kept it as as an ios.

302
00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:30.960
Caitlin Fisher: But also, when I changed it I realized I didn't have to write differently and I had to create different kinds of.

303
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.160
Caitlin Fisher: interstitial stories.

304
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:46.320
Caitlin Fisher: Because I was imagining that the form of the the 3D model of the castle itself was kind of holding part of that story that I could no longer count on when it became that print.

305
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.780
Caitlin Fisher: print activated work.

306
00:48:50.160 --> 00:49:04.170
Caitlin Fisher: I think i'm going a bit long so i'm going to stop there, but I think one of the things i'm i'll end with is I often think about expressive tools that I wish existed, and this has really changed my writing to some of the ones I always wanted.

307
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:13.920
Caitlin Fisher: That I thought would enable new narrative possibilities are sort of already here like even in the last year, so like real time collaborative immersive platforms like open brush.

308
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:22.620
Caitlin Fisher: And I often for this panel is the hear a lot about 10 nietzsche's observation that our machines are working on our thoughts and how true that's been for me.

309
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:37.260
Caitlin Fisher: And also that it invokes an excitement the same kind of excitement I find in imagining narrative narrative imagining new tools and platforms is not unlike the excitement I find in imagining narratives themselves, thank you.

310
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:46.890
Lai-Tze Fan: Thanks so i'm.

311
00:49:48.090 --> 00:50:04.110
Lai-Tze Fan: i'm really happy to hear what everybody's been working on and thinking about narrative as forms of connection and this connection we have 25 minutes for conversation, which is not bad, so does anyone have any questions for.

312
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.340
Lai-Tze Fan: or actually didn't margin, do you have any questions or anything you.

313
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.140
Lai-Tze Fan: wanted.

314
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:26.790
Marjorie Luesebrink: I just want to thank everyone, those were excellent presentation said and, more importantly, they brought up I think some of the most central issues that we're dealing with today, now I am certain that the audience has many questions and if they don't I have plenty.

315
00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:30.810
Marjorie Luesebrink: So, have you got a raised hand list.

316
00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:32.790
Marjorie Luesebrink: It.

317
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:38.400
Lai-Tze Fan: No, not I don't think so oh stephanie just raise her hand good first step.

318
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:41.820
Stephanie Strickland: um, I just wanted to say that.

319
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:58.050
Stephanie Strickland: it's showing me that Eric and caitlin and like cheap are all doing in a way it's something that seemed to me so important when Cohen said narrative in scale like she was kind of doing this in a.

320
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:10.530
Stephanie Strickland: More in a horizontal and a vertical dimension and Eric is removing content, I think that what I would love to see is the actual environmental.

321
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:35.010
Stephanie Strickland: Lead based content that stayed in place and took seriously this idea of critical zones that is treated in the MIT publication for the Z km show critical zones where exactly the point is to be able to deal with it at different scales, at the same time, so to speak, and that is.

322
00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:44.610
Stephanie Strickland: You each kind of getting at it in a different way let's see the life cycle or let's see that will kind of mapping what kind of environmental mapping will really.

323
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:56.970
Stephanie Strickland: Speak to people and and it's very hard to make people understand scale, but absolutely has to happen if we're going to do anything environmental so just just a comment and appreciation.

324
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:14.130
Marjorie Luesebrink: I really I really appreciate that stephanie because I think scale is one of the things we want to keep on the table here, and with that, I would like to put on the table as part of our discussion.

325
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.650
Marjorie Luesebrink: The issue of.

326
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:29.700
Marjorie Luesebrink: The issue of that will brought up of the vernacular at folk and how that has been superseded by all of the tools which promise to streamline and.

327
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:44.430
Marjorie Luesebrink: quantify all of our online works and kind of stand in the way of anything that is quirky or a typical so because I think that, because I think that the scale of folk.

328
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:55.110
Marjorie Luesebrink: expression in general is at odds with the commercial scale that we're seeing so dominant today, so we could like put those two together.

329
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:02.850
Will Luers: I have a question actually for Eric and caitlin.

330
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:06.540
Will Luers: In the idea of a.

331
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.390
Will Luers: Work of the lit moving into you know either scale or different.

332
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:27.360
Will Luers: platforms, this is an odd question but as anyone ever dreamed inside of an eel it work, I mean about an elite work, I mean do you dream of it in a in a interface, that is.

333
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:31.800
Will Luers: In which it comes, or are you in another part of that work.

334
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:33.630
Will Luers: that's for everyone.

335
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:35.760
Oh.

336
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:46.260
Erik Loyer: I mean it could say that I often think dream about I mean not literally dream, but dream imaginatively about.

337
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:57.390
Erik Loyer: A work that that does change forms it exists, over time, outside of platforms or across platforms and has the flexibility to do that, that it can you know.

338
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:02.880
Erik Loyer: live through times you know, especially as we've seen such prominent deaths of platforms recently.

339
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:13.350
Erik Loyer: You know, maybe it's kind of more of a a an attempt at self preservation of how do I make sure that the stuff I make actually you know managers to live without me having to rebuild it every 10 years.

340
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:22.260
Erik Loyer: And this idea of, is it possible to make it easier for these things to move from place to place they don't have to be exactly the same they don't have to be emulated.

341
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:35.010
Erik Loyer: But just to have some of the structure in the shape of it, you know live from incarnation to incarnation and move and i'm happy if it changes i'm happy if it if it morphs but just allow it to do that.

342
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.810
Caitlin Fisher: So neat I was imagining a literal dream, and I was thinking, I used to dream about tetris.

343
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:56.460
Caitlin Fisher: So I don't know what that means about narrative or the compelling dream space of tetris but you know, as opposed to all of your really it works that JEREMY saying he's living inside of eric's works, but not so lucky here.

344
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.020
I also have in trumped of.

345
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:07.920
Lai-Tze Fan: worlds in the I dream very linearly, which is the opposite of how I think so I don't know what that means.

346
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.710
Scott Rettberg: Is it okay my system.

347
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:26.580
Scott Rettberg: I was just gonna say that I think eric's provocation is very exciting, both because it kind of in a way it goes against the grain of a lot of what people have written about.

348
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:36.000
Scott Rettberg: Electronic literature, where it's sort of you know, the sort of visual representation and the text and the interaction.

349
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:43.800
Scott Rettberg: Are all sort of part of the poetics of the work on, on the other hand, I think we're, seeing as we look at as we go back and.

350
00:55:44.460 --> 00:56:03.690
Scott Rettberg: See all these efforts to revive works for the platform has has died or or sort of bringing things that are you know, a decade or more hold back generally involves this sort of repurposing of the text and the different elements.

351
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:14.520
Scott Rettberg: So i'm just one just sort of follow up question on this is, do you have a kind of inkling of a framework in mind.

352
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.330
Scott Rettberg: That would enable this, I know that a lot of.

353
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:25.740
Scott Rettberg: You know a lot of projects with other sorts of data do abstract.

354
00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:40.740
Scott Rettberg: The text or other elements, the content from the from the presentation, but do you have you know sort of an idea for some sort of platform or initiative that would make this more possible.

355
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:55.380
Erik Loyer: I think the the structure that i've been playing with personally is is quite simple, I think, part of the challenges there's so many different ways of combining these things, and when we start thinking about the interactivity.

356
00:56:55.830 --> 00:57:03.810
Erik Loyer: there's so much complexity that's involved that, for me, I had to I had to break it down to just linear sequences of content in which.

357
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:10.680
Erik Loyer: there's a set of characters and they take actions and the space that they're in has a set of states.

358
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:18.090
Erik Loyer: And that's not a unique you know set of constraints or way of describing you know content, but I but.

359
00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:28.110
Erik Loyer: To me, making it that simple also makes it shareable because there's so many different contexts in which that is applicable that particular structure of agents doing things.

360
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:45.900
Erik Loyer: That it starts to make it able to travel if if other folks are interested in supporting it, and I think you can build a lot of the other mechanics on top of it you're never going to be able to build everything with it, but I think it covers enough cases that it can start to be productive.

361
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.180
Lai-Tze Fan: Okay i'm caitlin and christy have their hands up.

362
00:57:52.620 --> 00:58:07.950
Caitlin Fisher: Just quickly I think that's actually so important Eric taking this in a slightly different direction and back to the idea of margin talking about like scale and commercial versus small I often think about these small translated works or small works that can be.

363
00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:15.900
Caitlin Fisher: sort of remixed by people in Isla that i've often sent out that have been kind of like code and content and instructions.

364
00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:26.880
Caitlin Fisher: As more like small artists books which has totally changed as my lab as many of our labs have been forced into directions, where there's no longer any.

365
00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:35.520
Caitlin Fisher: there's no rational reason to create your own software for people like me, because I have no competitive advantage so working in unity working in unreal engines.

366
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:46.110
Caitlin Fisher: Working you know, working with large commercial software has really blown that and I missed those times and I do think that there's something in that about small scale, instead of.

367
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:55.020
Caitlin Fisher: So I think one of the one of the things I got from your question Scott was around like scalability, how can we, you know it's about preservation scalability distribution.

368
00:58:55.290 --> 00:59:02.040
Caitlin Fisher: And I think another ways to go small where it where the the metaphor would be more like the artist book where you've got tiny boutique code.

369
00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:12.300
Caitlin Fisher: And the work and it's so you know point taken Nick that I think part of it is you know we be bifurcated them and that we, and I think that does other things.

370
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:22.560
Caitlin Fisher: And I think keeping things small and having them travel together and passing them more like scenes and an artist's work to be repurposed and creative commons is another approach.

371
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:28.950
Lai-Tze Fan: I have a thought on that, but i'll christie's hand is up so i'll wait my turn.

372
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:43.260
Christy Sanford: mm hmm well I feel so related to everyone and and yet different because i'm mostly reading, like all French texts, you know or may or something.

373
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:57.000
Christy Sanford: and looking at paintings every day and yeah I learned so much from you, I feel you know and i'm as an older person i'm i'm concerned with legacy, I know that sound might sound pompous but.

374
00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:11.100
Christy Sanford: I have created pieces that I thought were full of ideas that were transportable and i'd love for those to be and some of them are in in the works, but it's very, very difficult and I.

375
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:23.070
Christy Sanford: So as, as people have been talking I just would feel like Oh yes, I know what I know what that means I work so hard with drag and drop one time and it.

376
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:32.580
Christy Sanford: And now I look back and it's destroyed again when across platforms now it's not cross platform did flash you know.

377
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:46.500
Christy Sanford: Many things like that it's very frustrating, and maybe that explains why I did nine books during the pandemic, because I want I want what i'm doing.

378
01:00:47.160 --> 01:01:07.770
Christy Sanford: To have some longevity, and so I really believe in multiple avenues and as many as you have the energy and time for to learn about or collaborate with is fabulous I just I so admire everyone who's who's spoken today, thank you for having me.

379
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.840
Lai-Tze Fan: Thank you um i'm going to.

380
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:30.870
Lai-Tze Fan: go up to the chattooga a question that was asked by Jeremy height and he says semiotic Lee and semantically narrative has a shifting resonance is more porous than the general concept as defined would love to hear how each of you are inspired by the play around the paradigm.

381
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:42.870
Lai-Tze Fan: I think this is a question that margin i've been thinking about for six years.

382
01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:49.020
Lai-Tze Fan: And that's why we keep doing this panel and so it's a very it's a very good question.

383
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:53.490
Marjorie Luesebrink: You know, can I answer this question.

384
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:54.900
Lai-Tze Fan: Oh yes, yeah.

385
01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:09.960
Marjorie Luesebrink: Well, I don't know what the paradigm is, but I do understand the issue of of whether or not we consider narrative to be flexible fungible transportable.

386
01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:25.770
Marjorie Luesebrink: And scalable and all kinds of ways, and I, I believe that we tend to think of narrative as being perhaps a lot more flexible than it actually is.

387
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:36.690
Marjorie Luesebrink: The idea, for example, you know people said to me right away when olivia was going to be able to be played anymore Oh well, you know and just print it out.

388
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:46.140
Marjorie Luesebrink: But, of course, the whole point of this and, like she and I have talked about it stephanie i've talked about it 30 years now um.

389
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:57.390
Marjorie Luesebrink: What is it about the issue of electronic literature that somehow or other does in fact make it not printable.

390
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:20.760
Marjorie Luesebrink: Make the issue of how its approach, the scalability the way that we see it, and exit it makes somehow the narrative either work or not work, and I think that we, we have tended in our in our hopes to see things eminently always transferable.

391
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:29.550
Marjorie Luesebrink: Read renewable mixable that to forget that narrative is actually.

392
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:42.600
Marjorie Luesebrink: Pretty fragile and one of the reasons I think that we have a problem with people complaining that electronic literature isn't real literature.

393
01:03:43.470 --> 01:04:02.220
Marjorie Luesebrink: tense, sometimes with narrative to surround the issue that the narrative is not eminently always expandable and flexible and when certain parts of a carefully constructed hypertext are.

394
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:19.170
Marjorie Luesebrink: offended or broken or alluded, or in any case last that the very carefully constructed narrative Arc which still has to exist, even in hypertext can be.

395
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:48.120
Marjorie Luesebrink: can have its rhythm and its essence disrupted so much that the reader does not have the narrative experience, and I still think the narrative experience comes from a sense of wonder discovery um resolution and all of the things that we would think of as as in a classic literary experience.

396
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:52.260
Lai-Tze Fan: You had a response.

397
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:59.850
Scott Rettberg: um yeah well I just more of a comment, I was thinking about you know the the project that rod Cooper and I did hearts and minds.

398
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:11.130
Scott Rettberg: The one about prisoner torture in Iraq and then that project we produced in unity and originally it was designed for you know, a cave vr environment.

399
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:21.270
Scott Rettberg: But the interesting thing about that, and one of the aspects of unity is that we were able to reiterate it in a bunch of different.

400
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:33.060
Scott Rettberg: forms and the thing that struck me as we did this was just how much the world changed, even though those assets were the same.

401
01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:43.200
Scott Rettberg: So we did it once as a you know just for a computer for a DEMO and people walked up to it and thought it was a game, you know, and they were trying to figure out how they could win.

402
01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:48.750
Scott Rettberg: navigating this space, while hearing the stories of torture and then.

403
01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:59.070
Scott Rettberg: You know, we did it a number of different 360 environments, but then also work very well in in a kind of cinema environment which again was different.

404
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:09.330
Scott Rettberg: And we did it, you know, in a planetarium once and that that changed the experience a lot and a lot of it had to do simply with the literal scale.

405
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:25.530
Scott Rettberg: And, but, but I think it had all these kind of unanticipated effects on the aspect and on the experience of of experiencing it as a social.

406
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:46.590
Scott Rettberg: narrative experience and that had to do with the scale and and with the environment in which it was produced, but that was also you know something that was ultimately very exciting about having a project that could be reiterated, so that is just more of a comment on scale.

407
01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.380
Lai-Tze Fan: I have a oh.

408
01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:58.860
Lai-Tze Fan: Maybe i'll just respond, because as an afterthought to what JEREMY was saying, and then Nick has his hand up for after.

409
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:19.170
Lai-Tze Fan: So I also am trying to figure out what the paradigm means, but I will say that, as maybe one of the paradigms I think about what Margie is just said with regard to narrative as being flexible versus narrative when it's made to be inflexible narrative.

410
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.750
Lai-Tze Fan: limited by infrastructure in some ways and and this really reminds me of.

411
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:36.930
Lai-Tze Fan: An argument that love matter which made in which he said that he was surprised that narrative exists in the age of the database, this is like in the language of new media in 2001 but, of course, then.

412
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:46.980
Lai-Tze Fan: i'm Katherine hales argues against us and how we think in 2012 and says like actually there's many reasons that narrative is completely pertinent, we still need storytelling.

413
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.570
Lai-Tze Fan: and men, which is like an argument is that there's no room for like.

414
01:07:53.520 --> 01:08:06.690
Lai-Tze Fan: I guess deviation and meaning that it's all about transitions and like one line through and not necessarily all these different ways to tell to tell us to to make content if if it's like supposed to be.

415
01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:13.830
Lai-Tze Fan: Almost mathematical and then the concerns that there are the conversation that kind of happens between them also reminds me of when.

416
01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:23.040
Lai-Tze Fan: Alan lose warnings of like the parameters positions of code to structure and almost predefined are writing and.

417
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:33.150
Lai-Tze Fan: Now i'm going back to scott's earlier question about structures and platforms and what we can, what kind of tools we can use and i'm specifically thinking about my concerns with.

418
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.710
Lai-Tze Fan: twine as a platform, because if you are in the earlier.

419
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:48.570
Lai-Tze Fan: series of twine I mentioned that the interfaces now such that it's kind of like whiskey wig and you can drag and drop code and I think that.

420
01:08:49.110 --> 01:09:00.600
Lai-Tze Fan: Is as a kind of a parameter ization i'm trying to be positive about it as a form of access and increase literacy or at least transparency about it but i'm not sure it actually helps so.

421
01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:08.310
Lai-Tze Fan: That is how i'm thinking about narrative in terms of how it is flexible, but it's also being constrained and prepackaged and all these ways.

422
01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:18.660
Lai-Tze Fan: And Nick has his hand up and i'm going to keep an eye out on time because I just got a message from the admin person who's in the room and vince very diligent with our clock Thank you Nick.

423
01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:22.710
Nick Montfort: yeah, I just wanted to comment on the.

424
01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.230
Nick Montfort: diverse.

425
01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:36.390
Nick Montfort: sorts of definitions and meanings of platform and the ways that things like digital formats like you know, for instance, like the gift.

426
01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:54.660
Nick Montfort: Which only ELENA you know famously used in early Internet artwork is not a computational platform, nor is it a social media platform right but it's a format for animation that originally emerges from the context of one.

427
01:09:56.550 --> 01:10:06.720
Nick Montfort: communications platform compu serve and then makes its way onto the web and into the browser and so forth, and so there's this idea there's a sort of loose idea.

428
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:16.830
Nick Montfort: that's what people talk about commercially what you hear what you read about in the news and it's like tarleton gillespie's idea of what a platform is.

429
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:26.460
Nick Montfort: Which is YouTube Facebook Twitter, you know and so forth, and that's actually not at all what the platform studies series that in bogus tonight edit.

430
01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:35.220
Nick Montfort: deals with and it, you know, Marc andreessen his definition of platform that creator of macromedia director.

431
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:46.440
Nick Montfort: Right is that it's something you program and that's the way that a developer thinks about platform, very often, and of course the thing about it is that these aren't.

432
01:10:47.250 --> 01:11:01.260
Nick Montfort: Neither one is right or wrong, particularly the question of how these interact, you know, is probably a pretty profound one and then there's an and as Scott, points out there's also differences in sort of context.

433
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:09.780
Nick Montfort: If you, you know take really the same computer program running on the same system and you hang it up on a flat panel a gallery.

434
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:24.240
Nick Montfort: Or you, you know, put it with a game controller something like this, you know, then you get a different type of reception, so you know, this is all just to say that there's there's so much just behind this one word of the conference theme which I think is coming out.

435
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.570
Nick Montfort: In this discussion here that.

436
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:37.290
Nick Montfort: You know, is is i'll say you know, even in the rich work that's been done in platform studies it's not really been addressed, yet that's an area study.

437
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:47.010
Nick Montfort: it's not platform theory it's not platform science, you know, the way that people have tried to pick apart the elements of narrative in a certain way.

438
01:11:47.460 --> 01:12:02.580
Nick Montfort: So the question of how narrative and platform go together, we need to think we don't know what what a platform is yet I don't think and so that you know, so we need, we need to answer more of that question, at least to really make inroads.

439
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:10.890
Lai-Tze Fan: I think this is where Eric and caitlin his work really resonates for me it's figuring out by doing.

440
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:19.950
Lai-Tze Fan: and creating and using and hearing what users are experiencing and then going in and changing and tinkering again does anyone else have.

441
01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:27.420
Lai-Tze Fan: Questions or comments or anything I think we have about two minutes left.

442
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:46.800
Marjorie Luesebrink: I want to thank the panel, I thought those presentation was incredible all of them and I like to thank the audience, because I think that responses and questions were very, to the point, and certainly left us with a whole bunch to cover it, the next time.

443
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:54.330
Scott Rettberg: I think.

444
01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:56.160
Lai-Tze Fan: caitlyn.

445
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.580
Caitlin Fisher: Is super, I just wanted to amplify something Christie said because it's been.

446
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:11.970
Caitlin Fisher: An hour in the back of my mind when you start to say that you're you're writing became shorter and I thought about that a lot, especially with some of the platforms, where the granularity was tiny and the works and you couldn't have long form works on a lot of these platforms.

447
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:18.930
Caitlin Fisher: So just totally I think it's something that all of us need to think about in terms of, especially if we think about narrative.

448
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:27.450
Caitlin Fisher: Where does long form go on some of these platforms and I see i've always been an advocate for its return it's around the corner i've got a research project is all about long form.

449
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:37.800
Caitlin Fisher: And it never goes that long because of the kinds of tools we have so anyway it's just something that it was a great provocation and I enjoyed everybody's papers so much thank you.

450
01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:46.620
Lai-Tze Fan: So much for everyone for coming in, for all the interesting conversation and it's happening in the chat at the same time.

451
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:58.800
Lai-Tze Fan: yeah I Thank you everyone I am I i've been really enjoying this conference and i'm so happy to have participated in number six and i'll see you at number seven next year.
