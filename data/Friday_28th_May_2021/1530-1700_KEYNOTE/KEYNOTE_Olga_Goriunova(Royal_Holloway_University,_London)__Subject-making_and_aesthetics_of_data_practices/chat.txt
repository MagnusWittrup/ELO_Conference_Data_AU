17:32:41	 From Oreto Dom√©nech i Masi√† : Hola :)
17:32:47	 From Mark Marino  To  All Panelists : Christian Anderson!!!!
17:32:54	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : Hey!
17:33:11	 From Leonardo Flores : Soren forgot to push down on both the record and play buttons simultaneously.
17:33:11	 From Mark Marino  To  All Panelists : Andersen!
17:33:18	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : This jingle is living a life of its own - beyond human control!
17:33:29	 From Agnieszka Przybyszewska  To  All Panelists : hola y/and hi!
17:33:39	 From Johannah Rodgers : For those who are, like me, entranced by the music and graphics for the ELO2021 ‚Äúintro video,‚Äù I just wanted to thank Mattias!
17:34:06	 From ambika@dra.ft : @leo - that happened to me today at gathertown üòÇ
17:34:17	 From Jeremy Hight : I really want to remix it  and bring  a beat and elo samples to it
17:34:25	 From S√∏ren Pold : We should remember to show the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô version.
17:35:05	 From Lillian-Yvonne Bertram : Are closed captions enabled?
17:35:30	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : @Lillian-Yvonne: CC isn't available in the keynote format, sorry.
17:35:43	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : *webinar format
17:35:57	 From Mark Marino  To  All Panelists : and it was all in Fortran
17:36:11	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : are we sure it cannot be enabled?
17:37:54	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : @Stephanie, yes, it has to do with the fact that this webinar call is hosted on Aarhus University's Zoom setup, which has good privacy and guaranteed GDPR-compliance, which means that CC is not available due to the fact that it is reliant on Zoom's own servers, which are situated in the US, and so Aarhus University cannot guarantee privacy.
17:37:56	 From Jeremy Hight : ah run me   rip randy......interviewed him just before he passed
17:38:30	 From Johannah Rodgers : @jeremy has the interview been published?
17:38:47	 From Jeremy Hight : yes    let me find
17:38:50	 From S√∏ren Pold : Yes unfortunately. This runs on Aarhus University zoom, which doesn‚Äôt use Zoom servers. The good side is privacy, the bad is that we don‚Äôt get the services of zoom (or the surveillance).
17:38:51	 From Winnie Soon : http://readme.runme.org/organizers.php
17:39:03	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : @Malthe   but the arts webinar program has it enabled, is that a different setup?
17:39:25	 From Johannah Rodgers : @winnie Thank you!
17:39:35	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : @Stephanie, yes, the Arts program is running a commercial Zoom license.
17:40:01	 From Jeremy Hight : my interview with randy  adams  https://www.unlikelystories.org/13/adams1213.shtml
17:43:10	 From Brian Kelly : Wow. like the open west is unthinkable--now it is unthinkable that you can always create? oh dear.
17:45:49	 From Jeremy Hight : runme  was rhe first to publish my work...a project that edited a narrative based on weather html.....meant the world to me
17:51:21	 From Mark Marino : Digital Eleanor Rigby
17:52:08	 From Johannah Rodgers : These questions really make me rethink the question: ‚Äúwhere am ‚ÄòI‚Äô‚Äù!
17:52:08	 From Leonardo Flores : And Auden‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Unknown Citizen‚Äù https://poets.org/print/poem/c98da01f-2616-4f8c-b9f3-27eea5794167
17:53:44	 From Brian Kelly : Not boring. Scary maybe for how google sees us and how advertisers know about ut.
17:53:56	 From Johannah Rodgers : @Brian Agreed!
17:54:18	 From Jeremy Hight : http://runme.org/
17:54:44	 From Jules Chatelain  To  All Panelists : For the record : in this session Deena Larsen is appearing as "Brian Kelly" (he set up her Zoom and sometimes his name appears)
17:56:02	 From Brian Kelly : We are all binned!
17:57:25	 From Brian Kelly : and consequences for politics, exclusion, redlining.
18:03:05	 From Leonardo Flores : Anyone care for a cookie?
18:03:23	 From Maria Mencia  To  All Panelists : LOL LEO!
18:04:32	 From Mark Marino : https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/are-friends-electric/289193/homophily-the-urban-history-of-an-algorithm/
18:05:30	 From Andrew Demirjian he/him  To  All Panelists : thank you Mark^
18:08:47	 From Johannah Rodgers : @Mark Thank you!
18:12:11	 From Brian Kelly : Sets up cookies on nice tablecloths for vector tables
18:12:44	 From Johannah Rodgers : it is like the atomic bomb being dropped on the table
18:13:12	 From Jules Chatelain  To  All Panelists : +1 Johanna
18:13:35	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : @Deena vectorcloth?
18:13:57	 From Johannah Rodgers : @Malthe Exactly!
18:15:15	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : Deena's shower curtain fluttering!
18:15:18	 From S√∏ren Pold : Like socks fresh out of the tumbler‚Ä¶
18:16:35	 From Johannah Rodgers : I like to think of it as cloth that can be used solely to fashion outfits for other electronic computational machines
18:17:32	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : Socks in the tumblr?https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/socks?sort=top
18:19:35	 From Brian Kelly : And then... Q
18:21:21	 From Johannah Rodgers : Thank you!
18:21:23	 From Alessia Pannese : Thank you very much!
18:21:24	 From Brian Kelly : applaud
18:21:25	 From Leonardo Flores : Clapping!
18:21:25	 From Alessia Pannese : applause
18:21:26	 From John McDaid : <<applause>>
18:21:32	 From Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her) : Thank you clap clap clap clap
18:21:33	 From Christine Wilks  To  All Panelists : clapping
18:21:33	 From Leonardo Flores : Cookie crumbs going everywhere
18:21:33	 From Oreto Dom√©nech i Masi√† : applause!
18:21:36	 From Mark Marino  To  All Panelists : applause
18:21:38	 From √Ålvaro Sei√ßa : Thanks!
18:21:40	 From Magdalena Tyzlik-Carver  To  All Panelists : applause,thank you!!!
18:21:51	 From John Cayley : Applause!
18:21:51	 From Andrew Klobucar : Fascinating discussion.
18:21:52	 From Roberta Iadevaia  To  All Panelists : great talk, thank you!
18:21:53	 From √Ålvaro Sei√ßa : Palmas palmas
18:22:00	 From Joellyn J Rock  To  All Panelists : Clapping!!
18:22:02	 From Andrew Klobucar : I really find this to be important.
18:22:21	 From Brian Kelly  To  All Panelists : Question--can you talk more about the precision of the data --the vectors of being a digital subject--and the "anonymization" --if you are just some data, then you are not cared about as a person...
18:22:25	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: Perhaps you could say something about how these data points are not ever interested in our reasoning or our rational practices, but like advertisement-media, they are always categorized by desires and spontaneous interests. This categorization you mention is missing our conscious reasoning practices. A different picture of what subjectivity is‚Ä¶
18:22:42	 From Mar√≠a Goicoechea  To  All Panelists : Thank you, Olga, very interesting!
18:23:10	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev  To  Brian Kelly and  All Panelists : @Deena, can I get you to post your question in the Q&A section?
18:23:39	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev  To  Brian Kelly and  All Panelists : Thank you!
18:24:28	 From Johannah Rodgers : For audience members in the U.S., Olga‚Äôs talk really makes you understand the perversity of those U.S. Army ads in the 1970s and 1980s suggesting that we all aspire to ‚ÄúBe All You Can Be‚Äù
18:25:36	 From Andrew Klobucar : Thank you - really interesting issue here
18:25:49	 From Andrew Klobucar : Especially with respect to Hegel‚Ä¶
18:25:52	 From Jason Nelson  To  All Panelists : Giant applause continuing‚Ä¶..echoing from Australia.
18:25:59	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: Are you familiar with Pasquinelli and Joler's idea of AI & Pattern Recognition as a nooscope? It resonates very much with you work
18:28:35	 From S√∏ren Pold  To  All Panelists : I have a question: Obviously, there is an algorithmic dimension, but apart from this, what is the difference between between this distance you talk about and language as a system of distance and differentiation (following (post-)structuralism? Or to put it in other ways, in what sense is data a kind of language? And if so, is it a language that we can learn to ‚Äòread‚Äô and how?
18:30:58	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : alternative ideas:  Hannah Arendt, Simone Weil
18:31:50	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: had the honor of interviewing randy qdams just before he passed anr un me inspired me to make net art and e-lit....how do you see the connective tissues between nineties and early aughts net art and what is possible in creative digital work now?
18:33:25	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev  To  Stephanie Strickland and  All Panelists : Hi Stephanie, if you would like Olga to respond to this prompt of alternative ideas, please post it in the Q&A section :-)
18:33:34	 From Andrew Klobucar : But I think these abstractions perhaps present a very different relationship to subjectivity that your paper touches upon‚Ä¶ It is shocking sometimes to see how my subjectivity is constructed. I have a difficult relationship to these subjectivities‚Ä¶ which can be very stimulating. I‚Äôm not called upon to be a moral subject or a citizen any longer - a different mode of formulation is confronting me and I see that difference‚Ä¶
18:34:43	 From Jeremy Hight : thank you    great answer
18:35:26	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: Question--can you talk more about the precision of the data --the vectors of being a digital subject--and the "anonymization" --if you are just some data, then you are not cared about as a person..
18:35:57	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : @ Malthe  no, too far afield from the current discussion, but the idea that one needs a voice/person/subject  to take part in citizenly life, public life, that is individual created by a different type of community and place for it, is found in both Arendt and Weil--and if we are still back at modernism and enmeshed in white supremacy etc their writings are places to go
18:36:28	 From Brian Kelly : REduction to a group still reduces people to drone targets
18:36:51	 From Brian Kelly : or ad targets
18:38:20	 From Leonardo Flores : Makes me think back on that film Moneyball, in which a data-driven collective valuing of baseball players had a powerful impact on the game.
18:38:25	 From Agust√≠n Berti  To  All Panelists : data operates on flows rather than entities
18:38:38	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev  To  Stephanie Strickland and  All Panelists : A fascinating discussion for another time! :-)
18:38:38	 From S√∏ren Pold : Obviously, there is an algorithmic dimension, but apart from this, what is the difference between between this distance you talk about and language as a system of distance and differentiation (following (post-)structuralism? Or to put it in other ways, in what sense is data a kind of language? And if so, is it a language that we can learn to ‚Äòread‚Äô and how?
18:40:25	 From Andrew Klobucar : Leonardo - Or how a collective spontaneously formed on a chat group can save a store like GameStop allowing many to become rich
18:42:17	 From Leonardo Flores : YES
18:42:56	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: I like how you refer to this as omnivorous practice, and with this complication of a subject as a category I wonder if you could say more about who/what is eaten and by who/what? and next, how this metaphor works also for you in your thinking and analysis
18:44:05	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : I'd like to know at what level of abstraction I am located in any given practice-- it's not just the intended use, but how much recursion or massage or number of applied processes also influences the outcome       certainly abstractions concering weather can be parsed this way    or in general in a mathematic procedure
18:45:00	 From Johannah Rodgers : @Malthe I wonder if one response to your question might involve looking at the history of the industrialization of food production and distribution
18:45:18	 From Magdalena Tyzlik-Carver  To  All Panelists : <3
18:45:20	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: Regarding the very large topic of governnmental regulation of data collection and analysis practices, I wonder where and how you might recommend the government of, let‚Äôs say Britain, might begin.
18:46:25	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev  To  Stephanie Strickland and  All Panelists : @Stephanie, A question for Olga this time?
18:46:57	 From Johannah Rodgers : Thank you!
18:47:00	 From Andrew Klobucar : It‚Äôs interesting here: sometimes it seems to touch upon the question of whom we trust with our data - governments we elect or the private markets.
18:47:03	 From Stephanie Strickland  To  All Panelists : @Malthe    No. I don't want to deflect the flow. I have understood the proper way to pose actual questions. :-)
18:47:48	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev  To  Stephanie Strickland and  All Panelists : @Stephanie, good, sorry for continuously asking this - we just want to be sure we don't miss any questions :-)
18:48:00	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: If we are ready to move away from the question of the modern subject (as one based partially on ideas of digital abstractions, yes), how do new paradigms that reposition humans within other organisms and the Earth (I am thinking about new materialisms and posthumanism) impact your understanding of the subject? Thinking about the human subject never as a subject but as a co-constitutive element in a different life ecology?
18:49:13	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : @Johannah, thanks for your input! The question was asked by Magda Tyzlic-Carver, though :-)
18:49:49	 From Johannah Rodgers : @Malthe: Thanks!  @Magda: My apologies!
18:49:57	 From S√∏ren Pold : Olga also co-wrote this book with Matthew Fuller, regarding climate crisis, etc. https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/bleak-joys
18:51:13	 From Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her) : Thank you! Looking forward to that!
18:51:23	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: The "data" is not raw, as we know, it is always already a partial, implicated transcription. When put into a table, the columns and rows were, I guess, more or less agreed categorical infrastructure. What, for you, do the (generated) ML "dimensions" represent? Can they reveal currently hidden infrastuctures of, basically, implicated (algorithmicly privileged) categorization?
18:55:10	 From Mark Marino : Be sure to drag your persona to the cafe for snacks and chat after the keynote!
18:55:30	 From Leonardo Flores : What kind of cookies will we be serving?
18:58:10	 From Johannah Rodgers : Wow that vectorized data is experiencing some serious time travel considering the fact that Bayesian statistics dates from the the 18th c.!
18:58:11	 From Andrew Klobucar : Vector grammars
18:58:18	 From Rob Wittig  To  All Panelists : Existent/nonexistent caramel brownies; interwoven biome spinach/cardomom baskets; self-consuming cheese puffs.
18:59:10	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : [currently being answered]: I‚Äôm thinking of some of Ben Grosser‚Äôs work that leads to obfuscating data collection practices, like his ‚ÄúGo Rando‚Äù add on for Facebook, which randomizes pre-fabricated responses. What strategies of resistance would you suggest?
18:59:28	 From Marjorie Luesebrink  To  All Panelists : thank you!
18:59:41	 From Leonardo Flores : GIVE US HOPE! :-)
18:59:50	 From Leonardo Flores : No pressure
19:00:13	 From Agust√≠n Berti  To  All Panelists : we will be discsing resistance strategies in the decolonial panel later this afternoon
19:00:22	 From Agust√≠n Berti  To  All Panelists : *discussing
19:00:33	 From Dene Grigar : Jeremy, do you have a record of that interview with Randy? I would love to include it in The NEXT
19:00:52	 From John Cayley : Thanks! for a wonderfully interesting answer. I sort of understanding how these vectoral infrastructures are both operative and ephemeral; I just wonder if some of them (will) correspond to infrastructures in the world=history+politics (in a less black-boxed way that they already do ;)
19:01:11	 From Diego Bonilla  To  All Panelists : Through education: Teaching everyone, kids and adults, information literacy
19:01:47	 From Diego Bonilla  To  All Panelists : and computational thinking
19:03:25	 From Johannah Rodgers : Thank you so much for this fantastic talk!
19:03:27	 From Leonardo Flores : It occurs to me that using our accounts for netprov throws a little noise into the mix, as we become partly fictional in our accounts. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt scale, unless massive amounts of people participate in fictionalization of accounts.
19:03:30	 From Malthe Stavning Erslev : Thank you Olga!
19:03:34	 From Winnie Soon : Thank you Olga
19:03:35	 From John McDaid : <<applause>>
19:03:35	 From Agust√≠n Berti  To  All Panelists : very interesting talk!
19:03:37	 From Andr√©a Catr√≥pa  To  All Panelists : Thank you!
19:03:38	 From Andrew Demirjian he/him  To  All Panelists : Thank Olga!
19:03:39	 From Magdalena Tyzlik-Carver  To  All Panelists : thank you!
19:03:39	 From Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her) : Thank you!
19:03:40	 From Christine Wilks  To  All Panelists : Thank you. Clapping!
19:03:42	 From Andrew Klobucar : Thanks Olga
19:03:43	 From Joellyn J Rock  To  All Panelists : Thank you!!!
19:03:43	 From Leonardo Flores : Bravo! Thank you for your response!
19:03:49	 From david clark  To  All Panelists : thank you
19:03:49	 From Johannah Rodgers : I will eagerly await the book!
19:03:51	 From Diego Bonilla  To  All Panelists : Thank you!
19:03:52	 From √Ålvaro Sei√ßa : Thanks (clap clap)
19:03:58	 From Fernanda Mugica  To  All Panelists : Thank you!
