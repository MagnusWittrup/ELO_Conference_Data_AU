00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.570
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Hello everybody.

2
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.860
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I hope you can hear me.

3
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:50.430
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Yes, yes okay wonderful grace just always a little bit afraid of Internet connection, especially when it's raining but today it's sunny here so everything should go sugar find so what come to this.

4
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.470
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: conference had today dude and the law states Friday it's very promising it's a nice.

5
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.150
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Nice truck.

6
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So I don't want to waste too much time.

7
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:24.570
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In in in talking myself, I prefer just to briefly introduce you interview and and hopefully have a nice debate it's very, very, very, very promising and the festival land with bank Sullivan and Scott for this wonderful Conference, because I.

8
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.790
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: hadn't had the possibility, yet to do it, so let me do it so.

9
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.890
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The first speaker today i'm sorry already because i'm pretty sure that I will pronounce it badly.

10
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:52.170
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: bash let's let's see Michael don't omit higher maybe it's mikael isn't me crazy right right this tendency to think that everything must be in English, no it's me hello, SHERLOCK or something like this.

11
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.850
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Or you pronounce your name yourself, because I know that my pronunciation is horrible with a very interesting.

12
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:16.830
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: topic on the paradox of electronic literature on might interested in that in classroom investigating the challenges for new literacy practices within the platform school so me just.

13
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.350
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: To you, on.

14
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.920
Michael Schlauch: And thank you savannah and I just link my paper in the set so everybody can.

15
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.590
Michael Schlauch: see it again.

16
00:02:35.910 --> 00:03:00.330
Michael Schlauch: Okay, and yeah I try to keep myself in the five limit minutes limit i'm Michelangelo and i'm based in the University of Oregon and Italy at the border, or to Austria, and so my interest is in education and educational media and my starting question.

17
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.940
Michael Schlauch: Thinking about this paper was.

18
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:23.700
Michael Schlauch: Why hasn't electronic literature and the schools, yet or limit in a limited amount, and as we are speaking, as we are thinking and computers have certainly ended schools and and certainly within this this pandemic times.

19
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:40.770
Michael Schlauch: So there is some kind of paradox to disentangle here and my departure was to think about what are the educational types of media that are used many scholars.

20
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:55.320
Michael Schlauch: criticize or describe the situation that there are electronic books and text books, but they are mostly legacy media that are digitalized and they don't.

21
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.090
and

22
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.140
Michael Schlauch: reflect the notion of digital bond literature so so they don't coincide with the.

23
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.630
Michael Schlauch: border.

24
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.960
Michael Schlauch: Shared notion of electronic literature as something born digitally and.

25
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:33.570
Michael Schlauch: containing some some kinds of audiences that are specific to electronic literature So then, and the whole question becomes okay Ben Ben the school right now is some kind of platform that.

26
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:53.220
Michael Schlauch: facilitates conventional forms of educational media like textbooks what is happening right now but kinds of platform mutations are happening right now and what can be changed in order to facilitate a new forms of electronic literature in schools.

27
00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:05.580
Michael Schlauch: So if you talk about platforms, my second point in the paper is and that there is much confusion about the concept of platform, so what what is the platform.

28
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.960
Michael Schlauch: And we are talking about different educational platforms learning management systems and so on, and actually we have different definitions.

29
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.070
Michael Schlauch: And, for example, the early and paper by Ian bogus and the comfort and describes.

30
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:38.790
Michael Schlauch: Within platform studies, a platform as a system that can be reprogrammed and therefore customized by outside developers users and in a way, adapted to countless needs and niches that the platforms original developers could not have possibly contemplated.

31
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:47.250
Michael Schlauch: Then there's another perspective, which is more the educational psychology side of.

32
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:57.330
Michael Schlauch: The debate which defines a platform as a for women programmable digital architecture design to organize interactions between users.

33
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:07.680
Michael Schlauch: Not just end users but also corporate entities public bodies, it is geared to what the systematic collection, I will make processing circulation at monetization of user data.

34
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:25.770
Michael Schlauch: So there's the other aspect that which, which is addressed here which goes more in the direction of what is done within these platforms and what what what is done with platforms that maybe isn't contemplated beforehand.

35
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.720
Michael Schlauch: So.

36
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.370
Michael Schlauch: If you look at the the issue right now is that many tech firms are.

37
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:46.860
Michael Schlauch: In nevertheless and structured in a way, they follow a model of conventional schooling, so they.

38
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:57.510
Michael Schlauch: As a lot of, for example, obsessed with reference to Google classroom the title tested mechanisms and structures of formal schooling.

39
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:10.440
Michael Schlauch: Like classrooms coursework students submissions and so on abstracted into a predefined templates for participation So what can we do in our electronic literate society to.

40
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.190
Michael Schlauch: change things, I think that different issues that have to be addressed, and the first issue is.

41
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.130
Michael Schlauch: The issue of disruptive fixations so a lot of earlier work on electronic literature.

42
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.190
Michael Schlauch: was very visionary.

43
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.100
Michael Schlauch: Also.

44
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.620
Michael Schlauch: also criticized tokenism, for example, work, but by by.

45
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:48.690
Michael Schlauch: Many earlier works on the on the hyper text and time and then.

46
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.270
Michael Schlauch: The problem becomes when there's some kind of.

47
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.960
Michael Schlauch: disrupt the fixation like right like crystal sims describes weather is.

48
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:17.670
Michael Schlauch: problematic ization rendering technical and experts and Alice imagine every present figured words that are particularly amenable to incontrovertible with envisioned rabbit remedy, so if the fema envision avert which is.

49
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:34.020
Michael Schlauch: To which electronic literature is the only solution we fall in the trap of of technological solution ISM and simplification like simplified business of the digital native, for example.

50
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:45.480
Michael Schlauch: The second issue is about literacy there's much to say about literacy and because the concept of reading I think later on in the span of we will.

51
00:08:46.230 --> 00:09:04.020
Michael Schlauch: Talk about it more is very confusing, because we can also refer to the consumption of digital artifacts as interacting or playing So what is the reading part of it, and where does literacy begin and end and.

52
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:24.150
Michael Schlauch: The whole concept of literacy has to be we we considered, especially in schools and and right now the tendency is to go backwards to to basic reading and writing because it's the most clearest type of conceding in the pressing.

53
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.160
Michael Schlauch: And then the third issue is teaching, so all the teachers.

54
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.050
Michael Schlauch: A lot of.

55
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.330
Michael Schlauch: Electronic literature.

56
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.100
Michael Schlauch: happens outside of schools and.

57
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.200
Michael Schlauch: The problem with platforms and digital platforms is that.

58
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:57.750
Michael Schlauch: Teaching often is reduced to the advancement of contingencies of be enforcement and which, under which students learn, so we.

59
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:12.210
Michael Schlauch: Forget the educational part of teaching and only concentrate on learning and what happens is that the agency of teachers and students and gets missed and and the vision of.

60
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:23.280
Michael Schlauch: I portray in my papers in teachers becoming more like cyber bart's and says, instead of being standardized with.

61
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.310
Michael Schlauch: Learning management systems, for example.

62
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:37.050
Michael Schlauch: So yeah, this is the, these are the issues I bring forward in my paper and maybe we can talk about it more than yeah Thank you.

63
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.710
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Thank you very much.

64
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.670
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: very, very interesting.

65
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.590
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: topic.

66
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.370
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I think that, yes, we can we can absolutely discussing this later.

67
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.260
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I think dash now should be.

68
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.670
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And not yet prevent bar and i'm a right.

69
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.780
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: But I cannot see her right.

70
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:22.320
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Well, well then, I don't know so me, I think we we we.

71
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:32.580
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: We go for you and and that's it so me Spencer we'll just start now amplified publishing finding audiences.

72
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:58.260
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: i'm very into this founding audiences because well it's also linked already to water Mihail said because it's it elite, I think, just been for too long in a niche so this funding audiences is very promising, which is like i'm silence and we'll discuss later Thank you me.

73
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.920
Amy Spencer: Great and I wanted to share some slides do I have the.

74
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.600
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: should be able.

75
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.930
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: To now show me, I think I probably can.

76
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.800
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Yes.

77
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.420
Amy Spencer: Can you see that.

78
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.010
Amy Spencer: Just.

79
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.980
Amy Spencer: Can you just see the first slide.

80
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:28.080
Amy Spencer: The first slide Okay, and so my name's amy Spencer I a postdoctoral research at Boston University, which is.

81
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.360
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In the UK in the southwest of the UK.

82
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:42.840
Amy Spencer: And I am just going to run through some of the key points of my paper which I realized wasn't linked but i'm just going to.

83
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:52.080
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: me sorry to interrupt you to know how you want to to to to present this, this is not if I I see all the papers, not just the first line, so I don't know.

84
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.210
Amy Spencer: Okay, let me see what i've done.

85
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.670
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay now it's perfect.

86
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:03.120
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay, thanks okay I can't see my notes, at the same time, which is nothing but anyway i'll be fine and.

87
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.870
Amy Spencer: So i'm fine publishing sharing audiences, so the upside publishing project is.

88
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:19.980
Amy Spencer: it's a large scale project as part of the Bristol a bath creative R amp D project, which is a sort of practice based practice lead approach to research, where we.

89
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:27.330
Amy Spencer: provide funding and Commission producers writers theatre makers.

90
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:40.260
Amy Spencer: All kinds of creative technologists people who are working in the creative technology sector to develop projects and and explore research so.

91
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.400
Amy Spencer: it's a big project and actually publishing is one strand of it and that's the standard i'm involved with.

92
00:13:48.360 --> 00:14:05.040
Amy Spencer: we're thinking about publishing and it's broader sense, so not just you know traditional book publishing print publishing thinking about all forms of content sharing content across different platforms so that's why I was particularly interested in this yellow strand theme this year.

93
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:18.900
Amy Spencer: So it's looking at lots of different questions and my role within the project is to explore these different avenues so thinking about what publishing means in the 21st century, you know it's not just printing anymore it's.

94
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:27.660
Amy Spencer: You know, it might include publishing on YouTube might include tick tock might include you know all these different platforms that are available and.

95
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.030
Amy Spencer: Thinking about how you might expand traditional media through synchronization.

96
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:46.980
Amy Spencer: That you can move through different platforms you don't need to kind of stay on one platform and consume everything you can kind of move between platforms and get different bits of content and thinking about personalization so how how you interact with the platform.

97
00:14:48.840 --> 00:15:00.000
Amy Spencer: How it sort of taylor's content to who you are and what you're what you're interested in thinking about the rise of visual storytelling so not necessarily focused on the printed word, for example.

98
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.440
Amy Spencer: Thinking about a range of more visual platforms and how how that might influence the future of reading.

99
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:14.760
Amy Spencer: And thinking about who our audiences are, this is the crucial question that i'm focused on in my research in the moment who the audience is what do they want.

100
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:24.510
Amy Spencer: Where do we find them, so this is something that you know so many different people who are working in publishing and thinking about publishing and it's broader sense, where the audience is what does that mean.

101
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:33.540
Amy Spencer: So that's what i'm currently exploring and thinking about narrative based digital publishing because that's my background, so my background is.

102
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:46.320
Amy Spencer: Specifically around kind of experimental fiction and how you can explore kind of narrative based fiction, but using technology.

103
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:55.530
Amy Spencer: So how can narrative based digital publishing reach an active and engaged does it say engaged and active and engaged audience across platforms so.

104
00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:01.170
Amy Spencer: Looking for an audience, not just a passive audience, but it kind of active receptive responsive audience.

105
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:12.180
Amy Spencer: So these are the questions that i've been exploring in my paper, so how can we read his experiences be guided and mediated and kind of can't just throw a new form at a reader that needs to be some kind of sense of.

106
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.610
Amy Spencer: supporting them in some way to understand what the format is that can be done in lots of different ways.

107
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:28.710
Amy Spencer: And how can an algorithm algorithms be used to find a new and relevant content we've identified that's a crucial area that algorithms are very important and kind of searching and finding.

108
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:37.530
Amy Spencer: finding work, how can personalization help readers find what they're looking for so again quite crucial and something that's.

109
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:50.490
Amy Spencer: As we've talked to publishers through our project that comes up again and again, and how can platforms be developed in frame So how can people not only navigate different platforms, but how can they sort of respond to readers and readers understand.

110
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.540
Amy Spencer: Why can't I mean.

111
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:05.400
Amy Spencer: So yeah so we're doing this as part of the flight publishing project, and one of the ways that we've done this is where commissioning.

112
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:22.050
Amy Spencer: 15 I think the moment and research fellows and industry partners and so we've got a range of different people we've got, for example, children's author who's really interested in developing audio stories, but for children that are very inclusive.

113
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.660
Amy Spencer: we've got publishers who are interested in finding new readers and trying to work out.

114
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.380
Amy Spencer: How to position themselves in the digital.

115
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:43.320
Amy Spencer: we've got theatre makers trying to understand how story and narrative are being developed in that field so we've got lots of different people all over the different research question.

116
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:55.620
Amy Spencer: And my role is to kind of bought the support that research as it develops and engage with my own research in that area, so i'm particularly thinking about narrative based publishing and thinking about this reaching audiences.

117
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:05.670
Amy Spencer: And my experience in this is influenced quite heavily by my involvement in the ambient literature project, which was a two year project, where I was a postdoc.

118
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:17.850
Amy Spencer: And i've just put a little definition of what ambient literature is so situated literary experiences delivered by pervasive computing platforms responding to the presence of reader to deliver story so that.

119
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:33.180
Amy Spencer: was again, a practice lead project, where we commissioned writers, to develop works and we asked them to develop works that use smartphone technology so they sort of experimented and played with different sensors in the phone, for example, GPS, but also.

120
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:46.650
Amy Spencer: Other so your phone Nicola knows where you are but also knows what time of day, it is what the weather's like all the different kind of data that it collects about you as you're moving through the world, and this project.

121
00:18:47.640 --> 00:19:00.720
Amy Spencer: We encourage writers and readers to experiment with that and those kinds of technologies and develop really sort of immersive stories that you engage with through your phone so might get my.

122
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:17.520
Amy Spencer: starting point for airplay publishing project just thinking about this, and some of the things I learned, as I was going through this project, and so I just put a few finding So these are my initial kind of areas that i've started to explore, so the amplified publishing project is is.

123
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:29.070
Amy Spencer: There and started a while ago it's it's it's new it's kind of in its beginning phases of the moment we're engaging with people were beginning to research we're talking with people it's it's a kind of a new thing.

124
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:42.000
Amy Spencer: And, but my initial areas that i've i've been kind of going to look into in a bit more depth which i've been outlining so writers need to find a way to guide their readers and this was something that we found in the applied publishing project.

125
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:52.680
Amy Spencer: As are in the ambient ledger project they've got similar names I keep muddling them up and in the ambien ledger project was writers need to support readers.

126
00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:04.380
Amy Spencer: Particularly the beginning stages of the story kind of setting out what the mechanisms are you know how how you're going to do that, to prevent readers just getting very confused.

127
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:12.180
Amy Spencer: So that helps kind of reaching audiences through making things clear and understandable and avoiding.

128
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:19.260
Amy Spencer: kind of Illinois projects becoming quite niche and only appealing to a small audience, making it understandable.

129
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:25.200
Amy Spencer: That needs to be a connection to existing platforms that's something that we've been exploring and thinking about that.

130
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:37.500
Amy Spencer: This ties into discover ability, people need to kind of understand where to find works access needs and inclusion need to be taken into account that was something that we learned, particularly through ambien literature project.

131
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.830
Amy Spencer: You know, not everybody accesses works in the same way, so you need to be responsive and.

132
00:20:45.090 --> 00:21:00.570
Amy Spencer: able to support various needs and also works might not be for everyone so that's something that comes up when you're looking for new audiences for work, and you know it might not be that the work is you know widely appeals to everybody, it might be a kind of a niche.

133
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:07.920
Amy Spencer: A nice work and yeah thinking about what that means in terms of finding readers and finding audiences.

134
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.750
Amy Spencer: Okay, as a.

135
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.910
Amy Spencer: Quick fire.

136
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.740
Amy Spencer: approach to what i've been working on i'm going to share my screen.

137
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.280
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay, thank you now, you can hear me sorry ah.

138
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.370
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: very, very, very interesting.

139
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.890
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So, since.

140
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:47.850
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I think it will have time for discussion very happy about that because normally at the end lovely papers that we cannot discuss.

141
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:59.700
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Together, because so from lack of time, that your stay strictly to your timing so it's perfect so now.

142
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.210
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: it's not very interesting.

143
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.430
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: interesting.

144
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.700
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: panel the sorry.

145
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:19.230
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: topic, but I cannot see a I forgot my glasses sorry in class, so I have some trouble, so the name of your can see it, or they have some troubles.

146
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.000
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: He gonna crush it and sat with Russell.

147
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.660
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I did there no.

148
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.590
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Oh, we haven't been been.

149
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:40.500
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: They haven't told us anything, so we lost to truck so we have plenty of time to discuss that right.

150
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.650
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Oh that's that's bad.

151
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:51.360
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: yeah it's not that they have some problem connecting I don't know.

152
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.890
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Probably not so.

153
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:09.930
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: it's just us well, well then, we have lots of time to talk about your your your your both your view, so if you want to add anything Mihail and also me.

154
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:19.380
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: To better explain, because you were very strict, to the point, but since we have more time I think it's fair enough to give you.

155
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:27.810
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Were back so you can explain a little bit more, because in fact is the connection between the two, the two you're looking for audiences.

156
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:40.230
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And Mihail is looking for for for materials like Sally this it's interesting if you might add something we fail because you had a paper but.

157
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:56.370
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: You were very, very rigorous and me YouTube so you might talk for another five minutes, maybe an me YouTube and then we started discussion a couple of questions i'm probably also other other.

158
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:16.350
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: vendors have some some question, and particularly interesting in that especially here in Italy, since you are the border, but the University of both still is still on this side, although I do like borders because of my own own own history of travel around Europe.

159
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:24.360
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And then particular interesting also interested in also to see if you know about any differences between.

160
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.990
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Between.

161
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:35.370
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: What is going on in the let's call German side of Italy and the rest of Italy, if you have any.

162
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:43.410
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Any detail that you can share with us, if you are aware that you're interested in data and silent, otherwise it's me speaking all the time.

163
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.010
Michael Schlauch: yeah.

164
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.370
Michael Schlauch: yeah I can I can start maybe.

165
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:57.180
Michael Schlauch: yeah the I think the thing is in Germany and in Austria, and also in Italy.

166
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.750
Michael Schlauch: We have this more or less the same situation of.

167
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:11.880
Michael Schlauch: Educational media being more oriented at the conventional types of media so so.

168
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.920
Michael Schlauch: What what is happening right now is that because of the pandemic and home homeschooling and so on.

169
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:40.710
Michael Schlauch: they're much more platforms and during the schools, so what but hasn't been conceivable maybe three years ago and doing a Google classroom entering a primary school, I have two kids in primary school so so I see it also as a parent and what you can see is that.

170
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:48.690
Michael Schlauch: platforms are entering the primary schools and and maybe in Germany there's more skepticism about.

171
00:25:50.820 --> 00:26:01.530
Michael Schlauch: proprietary platforms or platforms that don't respect this privacy and they're more and more concerns, it will be a little bit more concerns but.

172
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:10.230
Michael Schlauch: The overall picture I think is more or less the same and what what what appeared to me, listening to to me.

173
00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:22.860
Michael Schlauch: was how how maybe the the distinction between authorship and audience is put into question by by electronic literature, because, especially if you.

174
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:36.270
Michael Schlauch: See works like ambient literature or augmented reality games or labs and so on, and there is not only the author and the consumer but.

175
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:55.740
Michael Schlauch: there's also a middle part in on it, and this is the interesting part for me, because if you talk about children's literature, for example, there's always the parent who reads to the kid and with educational media in schools there's always the teacher who facilitates.

176
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:11.160
Michael Schlauch: elaborates the material, so how can the role of the teacher be be adapted in the future, maybe with works that are more experimental a more embodied also more.

177
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:30.270
Michael Schlauch: More multimodal So the question becomes then Okay, because what what is the distinction between the author and and how much authorship is given to these middle worlds in betweens to the teachers and and so on yeah.

178
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.960
Maybe this this can be one question.

179
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:41.580
Amy Spencer: yeah I think I found that really interesting thinking about it was something that came up over and over again through.

180
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.780
Michael Schlauch: And the ambulance to predict.

181
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:51.780
Amy Spencer: You know, is someone reader is someone a you know, a Co writer kind of what is the position of the reader within a work like that, so when you said that that kind of.

182
00:27:53.130 --> 00:28:00.090
Amy Spencer: engaged with a lot of the thinking i've been doing, whether yeah the position who's the writer who's the reader who's the.

183
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.780
Amy Spencer: yeah in in kind of interactive works, where you're.

184
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.880
Amy Spencer: you're you're not kind of a passive type of reader.

185
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.040
Amy Spencer: yeah all those boundaries kind of blow a bit, and I think they're really, really crucial to understanding these kind of works, a lot of.

186
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.150
Amy Spencer: The time, particularly in that.

187
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:30.210
Amy Spencer: and be and be encouraged to project where your Presidents was really important you needed to be part of the story, you needed in some of the the works that we commissioned needed to be walking a particular route in order to.

188
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.090
Amy Spencer: engage with the story, so you were you were you were crucial crucial part of the story.

189
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.330
Amy Spencer: and

190
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:45.540
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: sort of questions, so I don't know if you want to add anything me I don't know if i'm directing you or when.

191
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.690
Amy Spencer: I was, I was kind of reading them, as I was talking about Joseph.

192
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.240
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So three questions, I think, very interesting.

193
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:54.900
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So.

194
00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:03.660
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The first one is by Hannah documents and then, so thank you very much for your presentation your projects are of course very focused on.

195
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:18.630
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: elite in different contexts, which are kind of interesting and, by the way, do you have any advice for other researchers in elite on how to incorporate different context behind academia and the elite community.

196
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.510
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And this is why also.

197
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:32.970
Amy Spencer: With that a little bit different decks that i've been working on engage with publishing quite heavily so kind of moving beyond.

198
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:49.320
Amy Spencer: A lot of projects are sort of focused on industry, and I think there's a bit of a move within the universities in in the UK to be working in partnership with with different industries and i'm do quite a lot of work around.

199
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:59.190
Amy Spencer: Working with publishers and and sort of technology companies and which, I think, for me, is a really nice way of working.

200
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:09.570
Amy Spencer: In academia and working on projects that I find interesting in a kind of academic sense but also getting to work with people developing those in a practical sense as well, so.

201
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.500
Amy Spencer: I do a lot of work with.

202
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:21.660
Amy Spencer: yeah practitioners it's a sort of practitioner focused way of working, where you're reaching out of academia and.

203
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:35.820
Amy Spencer: you're thinking about developing and making works lots of researchers, that I work with have a kind of dual identity, they might be kind of theatre makers as well or writers or.

204
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.620
Amy Spencer: practitioners of different kinds of working on, you know augmented reality works or vr works or you know all different kinds of things so.

205
00:30:44.010 --> 00:31:00.870
Amy Spencer: I think finding an area of research, where people are kind of making as well, for me, as a really crucial part of the research and it might be that you can find a similar kind of way of working, I don't know if it's specific to the UK or whether that's a way that that.

206
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.360
Amy Spencer: Research works in a kind of worldwide context but, for me, I found that that's a really.

207
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:14.100
Amy Spencer: interesting way, so the projects i've worked on we've commissioned work and then we've researched the work and which has been really.

208
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:24.540
Amy Spencer: really nice and it also involves working with different people who are interested in different things is the wave crucial to me, but I don't know that might not be a way that everybody.

209
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.450
Amy Spencer: Across universities works.

210
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.940
Amy Spencer: To be a niche thing.

211
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:46.530
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And me to do do do you have any idea, especially among us, because we are both from Italy and back to Italy, after so many years bros and they see that here in Italy there is this some kind of.

212
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:59.280
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Wholesale resistance, but they are really old say afraid but itself is so different that probably data knew how to cope with this with deal with it and so.

213
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:15.330
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: My personal experience inside the outside de de de de academy the academy and and I would like to go outside Academy, especially working with school high school banner just high school, but has also.

214
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.280
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Elementary schools, and I can promote our school.

215
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:40.890
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I think that they when I talk with colleagues or anything they they look at me like this is kind of weird stuff, but I think that the problem is in teachers, so they do know how to approach it or i'm mistaken, something that you have a little more experienced Michelle what you think.

216
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:43.770
Michael Schlauch: yeah and.

217
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.340
Michael Schlauch: it's it's interesting problem because.

218
00:32:50.820 --> 00:33:08.250
Michael Schlauch: The mentality is oriented or Dan not many examples of electronic literature for for children or published works that can be applied for for the pedagogical contexts and and.

219
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:20.190
Michael Schlauch: And also, the problem is maybe that there aren't any business models that are feasible or that that work in this publishing scheme which which.

220
00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.470
Michael Schlauch: Is we've remained much.

221
00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.300
Amy Spencer: proprietary so.

222
00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.670
Michael Schlauch: So I think an interesting way.

223
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:39.270
Michael Schlauch: To promote things or go forward is to attach or connect to the open educational resources movements and.

224
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:49.140
Michael Schlauch: And, and to look at communities of practice that produce their own material on their own artifacts like like.

225
00:33:49.800 --> 00:34:05.550
Michael Schlauch: For example, and progressive education movements and in France, for example, this the front, a movement and eBay and we're always thinking about self publishing and self making that the materials, another point.

226
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:30.120
Michael Schlauch: In Italy, is, I think the whole and Stephen literature and sector and because, if you think, for example, about sanibel Diary, it was a very famous student author, you need to leave my head is tender hundred year birthday last year, so it was really a big.

227
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:38.130
Michael Schlauch: topic here and the thing about Daniel data is that that many of these concepts and.

228
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:51.930
Michael Schlauch: How he describes, for example in the in his book The grammar of fantasy, many of these concepts and are like into in an intermediate.

229
00:34:53.040 --> 00:35:02.130
Michael Schlauch: step towards electronic literature, because once one thing he said, is the best the best story is the story without the without an ending which can be.

230
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:18.390
Michael Schlauch: interactively extended by by the child in the room in the classroom or by the tablet so so there's always this creative component and then the student works, and I think if we can.

231
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:25.530
Michael Schlauch: For example, when I approach teachers primary teachers I normally go.

232
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:31.050
Michael Schlauch: Go by citing these kinds of books, because they are actually.

233
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.030
Michael Schlauch: works that.

234
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:39.450
Michael Schlauch: That have something in common with electronic literature yeah.

235
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.220
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Sorry, I didn't want but Mike Mike.

236
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.530
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay, so there is another question, you might have already.

237
00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:00.510
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: read it, I would love to hear you both speak a bit more about how elite might be used to encourage into personal understanding.

238
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:14.580
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: and meaningful social connections, it seems like this is a key underlying point for bottle your papers and also this is more directly to me, but you probably already answered because I saw the you're chopping.

239
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:27.840
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Also, I mean is your paper available anywhere, yes, she she sent a link, I think, if not Could you provide any relevant links to amplified publishing project this conversation seems to fit well into.

240
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:36.600
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Our read that because I am afraid that I will won't be able to pre beats this could be that.

241
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.530
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Know sure.

242
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.820
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: paper on ambien to literature, which is currently being presented in another paper.

243
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.620
Amy Spencer: yeah Agnes good.

244
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.830
Amy Spencer: she's a colleague of mine working a boss, but she's.

245
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.710
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: telling me how how her name should be pronounced.

246
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.150
Amy Spencer: I said well i'm Scott is her first name I have never said her surname.

247
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.500
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay Scott.

248
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:08.280
Amy Spencer: that's okay I don't want to guess right now but um yeah she's working on and she's also part of the publishing project thinking about the art and literature so literary works.

249
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.080
Amy Spencer: that used to be our so yeah interesting researcher.

250
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.410
Amy Spencer: I included a link to the slide publishing project, and I can.

251
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.750
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay perfect.

252
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.890
Amy Spencer: and going back to the question.

253
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:34.680
Amy Spencer: yeah i'm not sure if you answer discussion and the encouraging interpersonal understanding a meaningful social connections.

254
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.490
Amy Spencer: And it's tricky because I work with.

255
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:51.270
Amy Spencer: In the projects i've been working with we work with writers and technologists and they're all developing different projects and some of those are really crucially focused on social connection and particularly around.

256
00:37:53.490 --> 00:38:00.810
Amy Spencer: lots of people that we've worked with thinking about kind of urban spaces and how you can build connection within within place.

257
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:08.730
Amy Spencer: As a particular research interest of mine, how you can you know make spaces that might have first feel quite anonymous.

258
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.220
Amy Spencer: build in sort of.

259
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:26.070
Amy Spencer: kind of meaningful social connection, one of the writers that we've worked with as part of the MBA and literature literature project Duncan speakman he produces audio works that are really.

260
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:33.030
Amy Spencer: Interesting in the way that they connect the person experiencing them to place so.

261
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:45.240
Amy Spencer: You can works with sort of ideas of serendipity and so you're walking through a city and you might be listening to headphones headphones and reading.

262
00:38:46.230 --> 00:39:01.260
Amy Spencer: Some text at the same time and and the way that he sort of choreographs what you might see around you so he you know, is aware of the the common items in a city space and he sort of incorporate them in the story so as you're walking you get the sense of.

263
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.310
Amy Spencer: Somebody of later trail for you and that you.

264
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:13.110
Amy Spencer: get a sense that the story is get choreographed with the things that you see in front of you, so I really like works like that that.

265
00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:29.400
Amy Spencer: You know, digital works that you know couldn't be couldn't exist without digital technologies but they give you that feeling of connection social connection and connection to place but through through digital lacks and yeah i'm into those kind of works.

266
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.780
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Thank you know a few.

267
00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.360
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: We must have been a dark by this.

268
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:51.240
Amy Spencer: was trying to badly describe it was hard to describe it without describing huge amount of things, but yet so wonderful work that one.

269
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.610
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay um I don't know Michael if you.

270
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:04.200
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Go to you with an English name me hi, why do you want to add anything.

271
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:16.440
Michael Schlauch: yeah I can add maybe something very broad is your my my PhD research is because it's in a field of media education and and.

272
00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:27.810
Michael Schlauch: I think the interesting thing about electronic literature or these kinds of digital works is that they portray the mediated ness of.

273
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:52.710
Michael Schlauch: interpersonal connections so normally when we interact with each other in social networks and social media and these kinds of things get invisible to get used to this, I wasn't and norms and and we forget or humans and we forget, and how these are mediated and and how how.

274
00:40:53.970 --> 00:41:14.430
Michael Schlauch: Is the platform how the platform is actually and conditioning and our interpersonal connections, so what is interesting, I think, is that the children already can interact with these kinds of works in order to see how is it to talk to a computer and not.

275
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:19.170
Michael Schlauch: presume that the computer or and be aware of of the.

276
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:25.170
Michael Schlauch: Of the issues that arise so computers don't understand anything so.

277
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:31.410
Michael Schlauch: don't understand everything or if you go to see the other.

278
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.840
Michael Schlauch: interpreters they don't understand everything and and so.

279
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.900
Michael Schlauch: Making these kinds of.

280
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:46.380
Michael Schlauch: Issues more visible, I think, is one step is to to.

281
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:59.820
Michael Schlauch: Look, to promote in the personal connections and because right now, our interpersonal connections are always mediated somehow by it by digital media and.

282
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:12.150
Michael Schlauch: reflecting on it and being able to reflect upon it is very important to be more and more important and I thought this is a very important area to work on.

283
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.690
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Thank you, I I.

284
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.130
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: totally agree, I think that in this Tony literature can really.

285
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:31.590
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Help a critical thing you knows like thinking how the interfaces they're wise they're.

286
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.230
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Thinking of water and green is like I think data.

287
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:51.150
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: social media tends to lead to think, let us think that there is no interface there that that's the real life and women it's real life, but there is an interface there but they will call it.

288
00:42:52.860 --> 00:43:14.520
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: interface let's say you don't feel that there is an interface there why, at least in in some electronically to military works that the interface is there, and you have to cope with it, it reminds you dash mean the recent mediation so mediated things yeah I think.

289
00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:29.250
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: That you're perfectly right that could be very an important aspect to to to to develop more and schools and not just and the Academy, just to research, this but to practically experiment this.

290
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:35.640
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: With audience in general, but in maybe in schools and particular.

291
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:49.110
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Other questions from from from the audience I don't know, maybe you want to ask something each other okay Jason yes please without writing just.

292
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:49.500
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: yeah.

293
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:54.540
Jason Boyd: Thank you, I wanted to I was really interested by both these papers that I have.

294
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.930
Jason Boyd: You know more than one question if if there's time but for me.

295
00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:06.180
Jason Boyd: The the question of literacy is very interesting to me because I teach electron literature at the at the at the university level, but.

296
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:14.760
Jason Boyd: You know i'm not sure if you have experience of teaching this to K 12, but I find their literacy when it comes to email it to be completely.

297
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:20.160
Jason Boyd: Non existent it's like you know you know you can you can you can expect them to read you know.

298
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:26.910
Jason Boyd: You know, you can expect that they know how to read, but when it comes to a lot of electronic literature it's really astonishing.

299
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:38.160
Jason Boyd: You know they might know how to use like a ps4 controller, but you know, give them a work of interactive fiction or or anything like that and they're completely stymied and i'm.

300
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:48.960
Jason Boyd: wondering, one thing I was when I was looking at your paper, I was wondering, because this is, you know my solution is that I actually get them to become.

301
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:56.640
Jason Boyd: Procedural authors themselves, I actually get them to create using platforms, because I find that's really the only way.

302
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:05.160
Jason Boyd: to really get over that literacy problem is to make is to basically expose them to what it's like to create using those platforms and.

303
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:20.070
Jason Boyd: And by doing so, they gain, I think, a better understanding of what's involved in these works, and do you think that would work also with the K 12 K 12 level basically assignments that got them to actually create.

304
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.470
Jason Boyd: works of 11 broadly broadly construed.

305
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.110
Jason Boyd: and

306
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.640
Michael Schlauch: yeah I think it's.

307
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.650
Michael Schlauch: Certainly the way forward.

308
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:42.780
Michael Schlauch: One issue I think in the digital literacy is is that we have not yet developed the right terminology so so.

309
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:54.840
Michael Schlauch: works of this was your works are either interacted with or played with but we assume that people are naturally inclined to interact and play.

310
00:45:55.230 --> 00:46:08.970
Michael Schlauch: And they don't have to know anything to interact Okay, but to read something you have to know something so so there's the literacy issue is disappearing from from the horizon, and then we see actually okay.

311
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:16.980
Michael Schlauch: And in order to enjoy electronic literature, we have to have some kind of literacy here and there has to be some kind of understanding.

312
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:30.570
Michael Schlauch: And we have to promote these kinds of understanding in school already in the earlier classes earlier also also primary school also before and maybe and.

313
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:44.430
Michael Schlauch: He yeah the there many base of getting children to program the whole work of similar patterns and construction ISM it revolves around this and.

314
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.660
Michael Schlauch: Never also problems with this, because.

315
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:57.420
Michael Schlauch: Children are not able to do naturally program so so that.

316
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:07.020
Michael Schlauch: The yen there's not yet a pedagogy for having them do these kinds of things.

317
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:21.510
Michael Schlauch: Within school and rest and finding the right places within school to do these things, because in school, we start with informatics maybe after primary school and and.

318
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.090
Michael Schlauch: Before this this it's only media education or.

319
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:35.430
Michael Schlauch: He safety education so so more of like a protectionist stance so be aware and and what.

320
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:53.670
Michael Schlauch: Children are told what they don't have to do in the Internet, but the creative aspect is missing, and so I think yeah I agree very much that the crazy creative aspect is the main way forward to to tackle these kinds of issues.

321
00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.020
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: yeah absolutely dinner, if you have read the chart.

322
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:07.890
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Like quoting inanimate hell is a lovely lovely.

323
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:24.600
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Open access experimenters sources from 44444 professors and colleagues are have one colleague of mine, and unfortunately she is moderating right now, on the other, panel that would have loved to be here.

324
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:34.920
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Because actually the audit or domain and she she she she she teaches teacher to teach electronic literature to.

325
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:52.920
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In schools so she well she she used the electronic literature to teach us the languages and so now i'm not a language that's caitlyn so it's bigger than that but briefly so she would have been very interested in that, and of course in any material is Swiss.

326
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.860
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A perfect example yeah but i'm afraid after.

327
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:19.860
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: It does move to to being proprietary yes that's that's true and well, they did an amazing work and, of course, somehow, but this is another aspect about electronic literature, when we sometimes this gas, but just as an really.

328
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:39.360
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Focus down to to watch that also is very tiny little tuning normally share for free all the works, but how they are supposed to leave, I mean many of them are scholars or predictions that already have some other kind of job, but they cannot leave on that so.

329
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.940
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: This is also.

330
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:51.660
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A tricky tricky point, but there are four more coming from God my glasses, this is horrible but anyway.

331
00:49:53.220 --> 00:50:00.030
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: yeah I did talk a lot about cost of production and do need to recuperate that I was exactly thinking on that.

332
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.670
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And okay me yeah, of course, you know.

333
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:10.260
Amy Spencer: Okay, I was just thinking it was interesting how that works.

334
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.170
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: yeah and.

335
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.270
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: it's amazing, but he has an I totally agree with you this year I also.

336
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:32.490
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: tried to to to do the same with my students but it's totally different because I don't teach literature I teach digital culture at the Department of design, so I was trying to work with designers.

337
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:50.010
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: and actually they come up with the brilliant design solutions, but I do want to understand this literary is that in literally in in our Chinese literature, I was a little bit woman, they are nerds they are very capable to do things but.

338
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:58.290
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The literary aspect I was like this is lacking here and even when they were like analyzing.

339
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.090
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: worked.

340
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:15.840
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: With the tricky thing I started, one of the lecture of that with Alice Alice on clifford's, no, no, she know that the work to sweet old etc, which is a little bit tricky if you don't know what to do, and in fact they were like kind of.

341
00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:31.440
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: nerves they did they were able to to generate tax and everything but and this tricky tax, they were kind of oh ma supposed to work here, so this is also quite interesting to me ways that I don't want to.

342
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:38.760
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: put pressure on governments, yes, so I didn't know that there is any other comments or questions.

343
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:49.290
Leah Henrickson: Oh yes please, please, please I don't know if you thought i'll turn my camera on sorry i've been eating lunch, as this panels and going on and i'm really glad I was drinking it was trying.

344
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.780
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Trying.

345
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:58.530
Leah Henrickson: I mean, I was eating spaghetti, so it is the least appealing thing to watch someone eat so for everyone's sake.

346
00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:06.450
Leah Henrickson: But this has been a fantastic panel and a part of me is really glad actually that it's just the two of you, because I think we've we've pulled out such a rich conversation here and i'm really.

347
00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:12.780
Leah Henrickson: pleased with that and I think this is i'm going to be the obnoxious person who's like this is more of a comment than a question, but I think.

348
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:20.250
Leah Henrickson: I really wanted to bounce off what Jason said about this idea of critical making I also teach email it to undergraduates.

349
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:30.870
Leah Henrickson: In a digital media program so i'm in a media studies program and these students have next to no understanding of what is going on behind the scenes, or even superficially and to get them to make.

350
00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:40.920
Leah Henrickson: And to get them to look at the code and really play with it themselves and get them to understand how it works is fantastic and the comment I wanted to make was just that both of you.

351
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:49.380
Leah Henrickson: in different ways, and definitely interpersonal skills work that's being presented in the panel and at the same time.

352
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:57.660
Leah Henrickson: What I really like about this work is that it's it's welcoming the reader or the person who's experiencing into the conversation.

353
00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:04.230
Leah Henrickson: And I think this is what really frustrates me with a lot of Isla conversations and where he let as a field has really failed.

354
00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:15.420
Leah Henrickson: And it needs to do better, is it so focused on the person making the artifact it's so focused on the authorial intention, and I know amy you and I, a long time ago and had this conversation.

355
00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:28.620
Leah Henrickson: Where I think that's a load of garbage and I I do read her response studies as my area and i'm more interested in what the reader has to say I kind of don't care, but what the author says, and I think when we're talking about.

356
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:39.750
Leah Henrickson: Our students don't have literacy well actually maybe maybe the fault is partially with the person writing the thing if you're not making yourself understood.

357
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:49.230
Leah Henrickson: You have a responsibility as a writer as a producer to to meet your audience at least somewhere in the middle doesn't even have to be halfway but.

358
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:56.730
Leah Henrickson: A lot of what I find is is I struggle with it because i'm like this isn't for me this is some sort of.

359
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:04.200
Leah Henrickson: Self indulgent exercise where you're trying to work out your thoughts and that's fantastic but it's actually not for me at all, and I think.

360
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.610
Leah Henrickson: Both of you, I just think I just like to hear you speak a little bit more about.

361
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:22.140
Leah Henrickson: How readers are involved and we talked about literacy amy obviously MBM literature is a really embodied experience, I would just i'm interested to see what amplified publishing is going to do, because they have.

362
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:30.360
Leah Henrickson: So much expertise there in that area, how they're going to bring that expertise into this project Mihail i'm really interested in seeing how we can further.

363
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:39.690
Leah Henrickson: kind of reader response exercises in educational context so kind of a comment but more of a please tell me more because I would love to keep learning from you.

364
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:44.460
Leah Henrickson: And Jason as well, if you want to chime in by all means.

365
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:48.510
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Please, yes, and just please just.

366
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.430
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: open your microphone and.

367
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:55.620
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Get in because this means that a few of us, and at least I don't have to read, because I.

368
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.340
haven't.

369
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.940
Amy Spencer: formulated my thoughts on this yet, but I totally agree with you.

370
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.080
Amy Spencer: That.

371
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:12.930
Amy Spencer: The kind of self indulgent nature of some works definitely is off putting and that's kind of what a lot of my work is sort of reacting against and.

372
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:21.600
Amy Spencer: yeah I don't know whether it's to do with sort of the intention of the author or the platforms that people are using or.

373
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:36.360
Amy Spencer: You know what it is, but a lot of the works that i'm particularly interested in all those more sort of embodied immersive works, but whether the reader or the you know the person experiencing, it has much more active role and that's definitely something that.

374
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.390
Amy Spencer: The amplified publishing project is really.

375
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.370
Amy Spencer: it's quite.

376
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:51.240
Amy Spencer: what's the word it's the word isn't quite commercial but it's you know thinking about sort of the publishing industry so it's quite industry focused and it's.

377
00:55:52.980 --> 00:56:03.060
Amy Spencer: yeah I don't think there would be much room for works that were to sort of self indulgent and we're kind of clearly focused on you know finding a market it's about sort of exploring.

378
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:11.040
Amy Spencer: Your markets and ways of commercially publish anything so, for example, the writer who's thinking about audio storytelling and using.

379
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:26.880
Amy Spencer: kind of voices systems like alexa to to share children's stories that you know is very much focused on the audience very much focused on who's going to buy that what's that going to be like you know all those kind of questions is is what we're thinking about.

380
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:32.880
Amy Spencer: yeah so how did you directly market something, how do you find audiences, is that it sounds.

381
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:45.570
Amy Spencer: kind of overly commercial, but I think that's that's just the bit of elite that needs exploring the hard to find audiences and readers and be quiet and upfront about that as an intention.

382
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.940
Leah Henrickson: I think you're also touching on like.

383
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.310
Leah Henrickson: conversations that are ongoing in the publishing.

384
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:54.990
Leah Henrickson: world as well, like it's great to have these these works, but how are you going to make money off of them.

385
00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.090
Amy Spencer: yeah yeah definitely so a lot of the projects that i've been involved with we've been working directly with.

386
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:00.870
Leah Henrickson: Publishers and.

387
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:05.700
Amy Spencer: And the tendency for publishers to see it as a sort of marketing things so.

388
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:15.450
Amy Spencer: there's a printed book and then there might be an APP or something you know something that accompanies the work but it not being the main the main work so.

389
00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:26.280
Amy Spencer: I don't know the answers to any of the questions that were raising around that, because otherwise I would maybe be doing it and I don't think anyone knows the answers and it kind of goes through different phases, where.

390
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:34.740
Amy Spencer: Publishers are very interested in technology and an experiment, a bit, and then you know times when it isn't happening as much and it's.

391
00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.080
Amy Spencer: hard to read what the trends are sometimes yeah that.

392
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.370
Amy Spencer: part of what we're focusing on.

393
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:42.570
Jason Boyd: Is is definitely that.

394
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:44.610
Amy Spencer: commercial aspect.

395
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:51.960
Jason Boyd: I would just you know, maybe add that you know I think the problem around this kind of literacy and you know.

396
00:57:53.220 --> 00:58:00.510
Jason Boyd: Being able to navigate these types of works, one of the major problems just the pace of technology right, you know it's like.

397
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:02.640
You know.

398
00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:10.410
Jason Boyd: You might have grown up playing interactive fiction, you know how to play interactive fiction, you know what you know you know that's that you give that to someone.

399
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:14.940
Jason Boyd: who's never played interactive fiction and they're completely like sort of you know just baffled right and so.

400
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:26.010
Jason Boyd: The dilemma, I always have is you know, especially want to teach historical works to be let you know they're you're obviously dealing with types of you know interaction that.

401
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:37.860
Jason Boyd: You know, have become obsolete, and so you can't expect you know students at 20 years old, to you know know these technology so it's a kind of an interesting dilemma, and I always.

402
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:46.860
Jason Boyd: At the beginning of my course I always use is is about a nose great article that, basically, you know essentially says look.

403
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:58.140
Jason Boyd: You know, if we want Isla to grow, we have to develop a literacy specific to that right because it's so easy just to dismiss this stuff is sort of you know crass and juvenile and.

404
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:05.880
Jason Boyd: You know and and interesting but that says more about us as readers and it says anything about the work itself so.

405
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:12.780
Jason Boyd: there's I don't think there's an easy solution to that, but you know I think that's always a kind of constant constant problem right.

406
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:26.100
Jason Boyd: And you know I find this a promise like you know I can't assign works that you know i'm terrible with do video game modern video game controllers, you know I can't use those things you know so it's it's a it's a real problem.

407
00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:36.720
Amy Spencer: In your talk mccallum you mentioned digital born for audiences and I thought that was particularly interesting.

408
00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:53.640
Amy Spencer: That you were I jotted it down, but I yeah you're thinking about technologies that weren't being used in schools, yet and and digital born and I wondered if you had any more thoughts around what those audiences might be in the work that you've done because that might help.

409
00:59:54.750 --> 01:00:06.300
Amy Spencer: Thinking around this particular I also teach undergraduates and this kind of work and and it's always a problem, knowing what yeah, what do you think they are no additional for something up.

410
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:20.580
Michael Schlauch: yeah, I think, and we can look at these audiences from different perspectives and if I look at expressive performances, I always look at this theme of of China Jennifer Marie.

411
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:35.100
Michael Schlauch: And, and looking at digital burke's being able to be participating prasugrel spatial and then inside club ED and and I think this is a key point, because.

412
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:46.500
Michael Schlauch: legacy books or paper based media can be maybe some of them some of these performances, they have maybe and but not all four of them.

413
01:00:47.130 --> 01:01:00.060
Michael Schlauch: So this is maybe the difference, or this is, this is a way to describe the main difference between order media and digital bond kind of media that the test or are able to.

414
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:16.770
Michael Schlauch: To use these kinds of performances and then these forums, is also provide some kind of difficulties and and the last comment actually made me think about paper I cited in my paper.

415
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:34.290
Michael Schlauch: By cognitive reading researchers undermined and understand funded bail why don't we read him hypertext novels and this paper is actually quite interesting to read and and I think it's very.

416
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:52.890
Michael Schlauch: Important to take it seriously, but I don't agree with what they say what they say they're the main departure point is that hypertext literature, has failed because we already talked about some of the reasons, because the early hypertext literature was.

417
01:01:54.150 --> 01:02:02.520
Michael Schlauch: Experimental it was maybe safe in those and it was confusing and and if you give a kid today.

418
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:09.540
Michael Schlauch: To child, one of the early forms of electronic digital maybe they have difficulties with it.

419
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:25.920
Michael Schlauch: So, but, but their main a conclusion was then to to say Okay, and we are not cognitively adapt to cope with these kinds of works, because we are inclined to have.

420
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:45.210
Michael Schlauch: Doing he did this kind of higher hierarchical relationship between fixed author and pastors reader and I don't agree with that this claim either, so I think here there's much work to do and to disentangle, how can.

421
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:55.710
Michael Schlauch: Be, how can we produce works desert of herbs that are readable that are understandable, also with maybe limited.

422
01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:16.800
Michael Schlauch: For for readers that are beginning for for readers that don't have all this literacy, even if we have yet to define what we mean by that and and, and this is this big challenge, I think, to do use all these performances in a way that is cognitively also.

423
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:19.950
Michael Schlauch: Not overwhelming yeah.

424
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.880
Leah Henrickson: I just want to step seven and say I love that article.

425
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:38.910
Leah Henrickson: The guy who gave me my PhD he's the one who evaluated my PhD so i'm really familiar with that work and I, I agree with him in a lot of ways, and we have, I think you brought you brought up a lot of really good points.

426
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:44.970
Leah Henrickson: That, I agree with as well, so if you want to write a response to that article I will read it.

427
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:52.950
Leah Henrickson: But I just want to say thank you so much for a great discussion, I have to have a meeting and but, if anyone.

428
01:03:53.820 --> 01:04:02.220
Leah Henrickson: Has any work they want to send my way, by all means, like keep me in this conversation, please i'm really interested in what you have to say, so thank you so much i'm going to hand out that great.

429
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.810
Amy Spencer: nice to see you again thank.

430
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.790
Leah Henrickson: You inside.

431
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:07.500
Michael Schlauch: My box.

432
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.670
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: On on dash I would.

433
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:21.720
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I would argue that married or Diana would say data hypertext is readable when his career and it locks of clearances than it's difficult to read I wouldn't.

434
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:43.980
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I would extend this to to to too many others electronic literary texts mean if there is clearance Dan the reader is stuck there wants to know more, if there is no coherence, maybe your she has lost so is less interested in that I don't know that's my.

435
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.070
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: personal opinion was still have a few minutes if there is any other.

436
01:04:51.360 --> 01:05:00.450
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Questions or thing dash you to would like to discuss on also and now jazz honoring Jennifer David.

437
01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:03.450
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Just.

438
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.980
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Just to name a few of them that they can see on the screen the.

439
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:18.990
Jason Boyd: I could ask a question of amy, this is just a kind of informational question i'm just really interested how you go about and what kinds of.

440
01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:28.290
Jason Boyd: Creators you end up working with and and how that happens, like juju juju five people have already worked in this space or or.

441
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:39.810
Jason Boyd: Did they approach you or how familiar, are they with using the technology is to completely new to them i'm just very curious about how those kinds of partnerships happen.

442
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:45.600
Amy Spencer: yeah so they work in different ways, so when I was part of the ambient literature project we approached.

443
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:54.600
Amy Spencer: Three writers, who are working in quite different ways in the field so capable injure long history in Detroit and.

444
01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:58.200
Amy Spencer: Then can speak man who had a really interesting.

445
01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.700
Amy Spencer: audio storytelling audio walk background.

446
01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:22.230
Amy Spencer: And then travel writer James athlete travel writer so approaching people directly you had you know, an understanding of technology, but also writers, so an interesting crossover and then for the slide publishing project, we had an open call.

447
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:35.100
Amy Spencer: To find people to work with to find research fellows and research partners, we had a quite it's quite tightly defined program because it's part of a wider Program.

448
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:46.200
Amy Spencer: That explores different themes over a three four year project so that was a much more open process and people applied and we.

449
01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:47.910
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: knew talk to them about their ideas so.

450
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:51.420
Amy Spencer: there's lots of different ways of doing it and i've kind of worked in different.

451
01:06:52.800 --> 01:07:00.870
Amy Spencer: different forms, both seem to work well, I think it's I I like the the openness of asking people to submit openly.

452
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:06.360
Amy Spencer: UN done with really interesting people that you might not have thought of working with.

453
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.570
Amy Spencer: yeah that.

454
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:15.390
Jason Boyd: Were there any qualifications in the overlay today, did you specify that they had to have a certain.

455
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.500
Amy Spencer: That one was quite open.

456
01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:31.260
Amy Spencer: We they have to be within a particular geographic region of the case and have to be from Bristol bath in the southwest because part of the aim of the project was to.

457
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:46.110
Amy Spencer: sort of develop the region as a hub for creative technology so they had to be from a particular place they had to the main thing we asked was for them to have a research question but question that they wanted to explore.

458
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:59.850
Amy Spencer: And then we kind of went through an interview recruitment evaluation process where we we did draw on you know what their background was and what they were interested in doing it was partly.

459
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:07.860
Amy Spencer: Research fellows but also industry partners so as part of that process, we were looking for.

460
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:17.850
Amy Spencer: People working from from industry to work with as well, so it's quite broad we've ended up with a really interesting bunch of people and they go through this year long process together, where they.

461
01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:28.980
Amy Spencer: Think about their research questions they might develop work, am I build something you know who my make something and, at the end, they can apply for prototyping money to develop something that they might have.

462
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.040
Amy Spencer: yeah it's a fantastic project fighting.

463
01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.200
Amy Spencer: Greek you're supporting people with resources to develop.

464
01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.820
Amy Spencer: interesting work and then making connections so we've got.

465
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:48.150
Amy Spencer: Industry sort of these major industry partners as part of the project we've got epic games.

466
01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.840
Amy Spencer: The BBC BT, which is a telecommunications company so we've got lots of.

467
01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:07.980
Amy Spencer: sort of interesting minds that we can draw on and tap on and the people that were working with can engage with those those bigger partners, which I think is quite valuable.

468
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.200
Amy Spencer: So yeah we can connect them with they can they can talk about things they want to do.

469
01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.750
Amy Spencer: yeah so fun fun project but yeah, thank you for asking more about that.

470
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:33.600
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay Thank you so much, and we still have a couple of minutes boss, I know dry and yet your question, it has been a very interesting conversations and discussion.

471
01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:47.520
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I love it, I mean i'm sorry for the other speakers that couldn't attend the conference or private thing is fine gosh I would say, like like Leo I prefer like this.

472
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.520
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: not like this we had time to discuss them to to.

473
01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:55.860
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Have a kind of a seminarian way to to do as bad, although.

474
01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:05.640
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Many speakers and then it may be a couple of questions and not getting too much into it, I I actually prefer this way.

475
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.690
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: There know if there is no questions.

476
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:18.090
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Was had the pathways they are opening up from the publishing industry for returning us out well yes.

477
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.040
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: yeah.

478
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.400
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: and be ready to tammy.

479
01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:29.280
Amy Spencer: is a big question for the end well the pathways for the synergy for electronic literature.

480
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:34.800
Amy Spencer: Is i'm trying to think and.

481
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:40.200
Amy Spencer: It shifts and changes so often so sometimes there are.

482
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:54.240
Amy Spencer: more opportunities than others so for a while, you know all publishers wanted lots of Apps for all different things you every book has to have an APP and then it kind of shifted in a different way, so there are opportunities for innovation.

483
01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:02.580
Amy Spencer: But often think in the publishing industry there's often not a lot of money to sort of try new things, because you know.

484
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:08.700
Amy Spencer: it's a kind of old industry based on selling print books, a lot of time, so.

485
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.790
Amy Spencer: it's.

486
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:22.770
Amy Spencer: It kind of needs to make commercial sense for people to innovate and the sort of inclination to do that kind of shifts and changes depending on you know economic climates and.

487
01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:32.220
Amy Spencer: All kinds of things and trends and stuff so pathway sometimes open up and then they close again the ebb and flow again that's my experience over the last years of being involved in that.

488
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:54.600
Amy Spencer: there's lots of interesting I think innovation in in other industries, so a lot of the work that I research this kind of crossover with people working in theater and kind of immersive theater and not necessarily electronic literature, but really interesting use of technology.

489
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.680
Amy Spencer: In a creative way so thinking about vr and.

490
01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:11.700
Amy Spencer: ar and sort of immersive by normal sound and all those kinds of things there's lots of seems to be a lot of innovation in that area it's kind of in a tangent but um.

491
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:13.200
David Clark: yeah.

492
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:23.490
David Clark: carry on with it i've always been kind of curious about how the tablet form develops and how they're being there was a separate kind of technological development that took you towards the.

493
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:34.770
David Clark: You know, really kind of inflexible digital platform that a lot of print books were delivered on and it seemed like we had the opportunity with mobile.

494
01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:47.340
David Clark: Technologies to have something that was you know much more flexible, but nothing was really built into the ones that were really proprietorial for delivering books that allowed for interactive literature.

495
01:12:47.790 --> 01:13:02.520
David Clark: And seems like we're doing a large kind of work around by trying to get other kinds of technologies into people who are really centered on on books, whereas the the technology that the book industry developed is so inflexible.

496
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.930
David Clark: I just wonder if you guys are doing any any work around that particular kind of hardware problem.

497
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:14.760
Amy Spencer: And i'm not necessarily, but I do.

498
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:29.790
Amy Spencer: recognize it to be things that you know people like print books and really committed to that and then trying to push aim do something interactive it in different ways, might be that the those particular audiences aren't receptive.

499
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.530
Amy Spencer: And they might be more overlap with people who are interested in games than people who are interested in books at times.

500
