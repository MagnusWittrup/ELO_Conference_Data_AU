00:47:38	Hannah Ackermans:	Thank you very much for your presentation! Your projects are of course very focused on e-lit in different contexts. Do you have any advice for other researchers in e-lit on how to incorporate different contexts beyond academia and the e-lit community?
00:49:09	Leah Henrickson:	I would love to hear you both speak a bit more about how e-lit might be used to encourage interpersonal understanding and meaningful social connections? It seems like this is a key underlying point for both of your papers.
00:49:53	Leah Henrickson:	Also, Amy, is your paper available anywhere? If not, could you provide any relevant links to the Amplified Publishing project?
00:51:51	Leah Henrickson:	This conversation seems to fit well into Agnieszka Przybyszewska's paper on ambient literature, which is currently being presented in another panel.
00:55:23	Amy Spencer:	For more on Amplified Publishing go here: https://bristolbathcreative.org/
00:56:10	Amy Spencer:	Ah, yes, Agnieszka is a colleague of mine! Her work is excellent.
01:02:47	Jennifer Dellner:	Loved “it must have been dark by then” by speakman
01:07:34	Leah Henrickson:	YES JASON
01:08:34	Jennifer Dellner:	@Jason: Hard agree!
01:10:08	Jennifer Dellner:	I think this happened with the Inanimate Alice project (esp in Australia, but also elsewhere). It started out as open source, but now I think is moving toward being proprietary, if I recall from a presentation by its creators in … Cork?
01:10:31	Leah Henrickson:	Yeah, I believe Mez's latest (Perpetual Nomads?) is for purchase now?
01:10:38	Jennifer Dellner:	K-12 students made their own episodes of Inanimate Alice, a sort of digital fanfic
01:11:02	GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO:	yes
01:11:11	Jennifer Dellner:	@Leah: yes - they also have plans for aligning IA with curricular guidelines, etc
01:11:31	Leah Henrickson:	I love that, Jennifer. I wasn't aware!
01:12:18	Jennifer Dellner:	@Leah: it seems, though, that it will no longer be open source? They talked a lot about the cost of production and the need to recuperate it, etc. I don’t have all the facts; just remembering the panel
01:12:50	Amy Spencer:	I work with Kate Pullinger, who wrote Inanimate Alice, on the Amplified Publishing project and previously on the Ambient Literature project. It’s interesting to see how her ideas have evolved.
01:13:19	Jason Boyd:	https://perpetual-nomads.com/
01:15:59	Jennifer Dellner:	@Leah : Absolutely agree
01:16:46	Hannah Ackermans:	I agree, I teach e-lit to first-year undergrads and the creative assignments are so important!
01:18:58	Jennifer Dellner:	Just fyi, the Inanimate Alice panel that was at Cork was ELO2019University College Cork#ELOcork82Beyond the Page: Moving Toward a New Canon of Literature with Inanimate AliceAmanda Hovious(University of North Texas), Valerie Shinas (Lesley University) & Ian Harper (Bradfield Company). Abstract is in the archived programme, here: https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/8128/ELO2019_programme.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y
01:20:42	Jennifer Dellner:	If of interest, here is a screenshot of that abstract.
01:21:00	Leah Henrickson:	Thanks, Jennifer!
01:21:35	Jennifer Dellner:	:-) Sorry no camera, no sound. Covered with mud from garden
01:21:52	GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO:	https://www.ledonline.it/index.php/transmedialiteracy/search/authors/view?firstName=Fernanda&middleName=&lastName=Bonacho&affiliation=Escola%20Superior%20de%20Comunica%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Social%20-%20Lisboa&country=PT
01:22:19	GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO:	an article on Inanimate Alice that could be interesting for you all
01:23:03	GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO:	https://www.ledonline.it/index.php/transmedialiteracy
01:23:08	Jennifer Dellner:	nice!
01:25:16	Hannah Ackermans:	Why don’t we read hypertext novels?https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1354856515586042
01:25:32	Amy Spencer:	Thanks for the link!
01:26:36	Leah Henrickson:	I have a student meeting to get to, but will definitely watch the rest of this session's recording. Thank you, all!
01:27:07	Hannah Ackermans:	YES!!
01:33:21	Jennifer Dellner:	This was a lovely conversation.
01:33:25	David Clark:	What are the pathways that are opening up from the publishing industry for Electronic Literature?
01:33:36	Hannah Ackermans:	Thank you for your presentations and the rich conversation!
01:36:29	Jason Boyd:	CHeck out my paper on ‘TabLit’ delivered earlier at the conference!
01:37:58	Jennifer Dellner:	Thank you!
01:38:06	Amy Spencer:	Thank you everyone!
01:38:06	David Clark:	Thank you
