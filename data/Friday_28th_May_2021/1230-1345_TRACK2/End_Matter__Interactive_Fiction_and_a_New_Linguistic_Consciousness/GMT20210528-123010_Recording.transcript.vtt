11
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.890
Andrew Klobucar: functional or operational questions or points you want to make keiko go right ahead.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.670
Kate T: I think that's everything I forgetting anything anyone else was expecting me to say.

Andrew Klobucar: Alright, so i'm going to share my screen I guess.

21
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.030
Andrew Klobucar: we'll start here and it's a panel discussion, so our narratives are sort of interwoven of course that's a key thing.

22
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.640
Andrew Klobucar: and

23
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.150
Andrew Klobucar: Most of all, we just want to.

24
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.530
Andrew Klobucar: stimulate a good conversation.

25
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:14.130
Andrew Klobucar: At least that's what we've been having together before the before the conference and look forward to any comments or even you know suggestions you know, in terms of some of the questions and ideas we raise I thank everybody.

26
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.450
Andrew Klobucar: for coming here also want to thank the yellow of course for for bringing our panel into the conference, this has.

27
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:34.140
Andrew Klobucar: always been a great moment for me, I look forward to the conference, every year, so I do want to thank the Organization for the support and the help I know it goes on it's incredible amount of work.

28
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.730
Andrew Klobucar: As an organization incredibly helpful and I would say that you know I get most of my teaching ideas and theoretical questions that come out of here, I always need.

29
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:55.050
Andrew Klobucar: time to sort of unwind after the Conference to try and set all the tabs and ideas that have opened up in my mind, and also on the screen.

30
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:06.390
Andrew Klobucar: And I do want to give a special thank you to the organizers sore and Scott for the incredible work the exhibitions the arts, the discussions that come forward the discord channel, this is, this is an amazing.

31
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.020
Andrew Klobucar: occurrence and.

32
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.280
Andrew Klobucar: monumental, I suppose, in many ways.

33
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:29.460
Andrew Klobucar: And so we'll we'll start here for this first one, I just want to start by raising some questions and also maybe tie into some of the panels some of the papers that follow so i'll just start.

34
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.180
Andrew Klobucar: With mine here interactive geminis.

35
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.420
Andrew Klobucar: And i'll be talking about performance sculpture, and the digital aggregate.

36
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:55.950
Andrew Klobucar: I also want to start with, with two I think very monumental in ways very significant openings in literature and in culture in general one they span by 60 years.

37
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:17.790
Andrew Klobucar: The first one is Robert duncan's debut it was his first real collection of poetry, and this was the opening of the field, which was published first in 1960 very important because it also prompted or was a kind of a venue for his first major.

38
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:29.280
Andrew Klobucar: poetry project, the structure of rhyme and I start there with the very first lines of the structure of run speak to I named myself your master who come to serve writing.

39
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.990
Andrew Klobucar: He says, his first a search in obedience, this was an extremely significant idea, very important.

40
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:46.980
Andrew Klobucar: Because it prompted this this this these other discussions in the new American poetry movement of which Robert Duncan was considered to be a primary.

41
00:05:47.610 --> 00:06:01.320
Andrew Klobucar: force in it, as it as it move forward and he was also really trying to separate his postwar modernist view from the earlier view that was still associated with pound.

42
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:18.150
Andrew Klobucar: Were writing and language was considered to be a tool for precision, a better tool for precision than any kind of pros this was this was it for pound you really had you really had to make writing your service your service and Duncan had a very different idea.

43
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:35.790
Andrew Klobucar: That that I found fascinating and it may be, it plays in here to these questions about aesthetics, and the digital era, the other opening happen much, much later in fact it happened pretty close to our moment here, this is the opening.

44
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.560
Andrew Klobucar: Of.

45
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.270
Andrew Klobucar: The.

46
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:48.630
Andrew Klobucar: travis Scott concert it happened about a month ago in the digital game, the battle royale game.

47
00:06:49.080 --> 00:07:04.560
Andrew Klobucar: fortnight where travis Scott was asked, and they plan this incredible concert, where he performed as an Avatar which is great, for his work and also we attended as avatars 12 million of us listened to travis scott's.

48
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.460
Andrew Klobucar: performance and his work.

49
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.120
Andrew Klobucar: So how are these two related they do actually share a lot of interesting aesthetic.

50
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:34.020
Andrew Klobucar: questions, and this is something that I just want to sort of put together as a as a moment of consensus but also moment of distances and that's his first line from astronomical which was taken from his song sicko and the concert itself, the project itself was was named astronomical.

51
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:46.140
Andrew Klobucar: To win the retreat we're all in too deep sorry i'm not going to sing it, but I just want to sort of move into those lines, maybe i'll sing it later in the CAFE.

52
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.890
Andrew Klobucar: So.

53
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.410
Andrew Klobucar: Moving forward.

54
00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:06.540
Andrew Klobucar: I think these openings signify a broader argument with both the concrete and the symbolic limits of established cultural forms and techniques, we see travis Scott as kind of experimental in the sense because.

55
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:18.360
Andrew Klobucar: Working with fortnight there isn't a static argument here is saying as fortnight is saying that we really don't need these platforms.

56
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:31.140
Andrew Klobucar: Just as games, especially battle royale they're very important as concert venues, we can do anything we can do readings, we can do concerts we can have any kind of event at all this is, this is a platform for everything.

57
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:42.810
Andrew Klobucar: And this is very significant, because it was actually a lawsuit that was that just concluded this week with apple and fortnight is also saying to apple listen you you're.

58
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.380
Andrew Klobucar: We have to take you down because you're controlling the economic structures of the digital.

59
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:58.440
Andrew Klobucar: of digital culture, and we feel that the battle royale we feel as fortnight, this is something that we want to open up, we want to actually take.

60
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:06.390
Andrew Klobucar: The power from you and give it, they say quite, quite honestly, give it to everybody, this is also something that Robert Duncan was saying.

61
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:15.180
Andrew Klobucar: In a in a in a very important way, he said, the the modernism of the past was really to structural it was done.

62
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:25.530
Andrew Klobucar: dominated by several figures, we want to actually have a much more interactive he didn't use that word, specifically, but he was saying that we, we are giving and we are receiving.

63
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:38.970
Andrew Klobucar: In this modernist moment for tonight is much more much more explicit, but we know of course that fortnight and travis scott's approach to openness to an opening.

64
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:46.830
Andrew Klobucar: of a different kind of field points towards a different kind of harvesting and I think we'll see this and Rebecca rouses paper.

65
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:58.950
Andrew Klobucar: where she says, we are in fact using fortnight she doesn't say, for now, but I think it falls very strongly into a paper, in a sense that we're harvesting data.

66
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:10.020
Andrew Klobucar: Because it is valuable, we have to harvest it because we have to sell it, and this is something that the merchants of data are very, very.

67
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:26.940
Andrew Klobucar: Inspired by so we do get this neo liberal perspective of opening the field, we need to also take down now, this is also, I think kind of complicated for us who might be more ideologically persuaded by the left.

68
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:33.270
Andrew Klobucar: which says, in fact, that we have to be a little bit skeptical, we have to little be, we have to be a little bit.

69
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.610
Andrew Klobucar: Much more critical of this kind of opening because it's a neoliberalism.

70
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:52.020
Andrew Klobucar: which says that in fact yeah every kind of social activity can go into the work, because we can make money from it it's an economic structure and this most maybe more towards glucose critique in.

71
00:10:52.770 --> 00:11:14.010
Andrew Klobucar: The late 70s, of course, because when we look at neoliberalism, as for co said quite explicitly It really is a way of economic of economic colonization of every kind of social activity and, in many ways this event that happened a month ago does sort of.

72
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.010
Andrew Klobucar: present the the real.

73
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:37.890
Andrew Klobucar: promise of that and we've done it fortnight and the battle rail system says look we're proving it to 12 million people can actually sit and give their data up and have a good time, at the same time they're enjoying the travis Scott work, so we have this problem with.

74
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:49.920
Andrew Klobucar: With openness that I think we can solve aesthetically and I also talk a little bit about here, in the sense that, as we move into.

75
00:11:50.550 --> 00:12:04.530
Andrew Klobucar: I want to steal a phrase from Michelle de Soto, the scriptural economy, as we move into a kind of post scriptural economy and the knowledge system that comes with that post scriptural economy, we understand that writing.

76
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.330
Andrew Klobucar: For Soto, as a scriptural apparatus of like page.

77
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:22.710
Andrew Klobucar: we're leaving that kind of script scriptural economy for this post scriptural economy, which is in many ways, according to neoliberalism, much more open and I point.

78
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:32.910
Andrew Klobucar: For the fact that this practice of everyday life, this new practice of everyday life can be written in a digital environment.

79
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:45.330
Andrew Klobucar: very specifically using some of his terms, we are kind of moving forward with a different kind of post scriptural knowledge, so do we need a post scriptural.

80
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:54.450
Andrew Klobucar: aesthetics, and how do we define this now i've seen this question come up in a lot of different panels it's, it is a very hot.

81
00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:09.300
Andrew Klobucar: Discussion topic and I don't want to present any solutions, but I do want to ask for perhaps some ideas for some models, the best one of the best analyses of a scriptural economy and the knowledge system.

82
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.870
Andrew Klobucar: That comes.

83
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.100
Andrew Klobucar: With it, of course, comes from Lisa gentleman's work paper knowledge.

84
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.890
Andrew Klobucar: where she sorry.

85
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.990
Andrew Klobucar: Most crazy here when she says that paper.

86
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:30.420
Andrew Klobucar: serves as a figure for all that is external to the mind, now we have the screen serving as that same kind of symbol.

87
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:43.530
Andrew Klobucar: We have had some really fascinating aesthetic responses to the document that function very, very well in the digital world, and that is something that we've seen in some panels here, of course.

88
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.590
Andrew Klobucar: As we see the novel.

89
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:54.750
Andrew Klobucar: As a fantastic model of aesthetic response to the scriptural economy.

90
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:04.650
Andrew Klobucar: It does, I think, define a moment of aesthetic exile and that's why it's so interesting and I noticed, of course, that as.

91
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:17.670
Andrew Klobucar: We see JESSICA precedents work the novel became even more interesting as we moved into the digital era and she makes this argument very, very well, and she points to work, such as mark.

92
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.990
Andrew Klobucar: Zen Zen Daniel left skis book house of leaves.

93
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:34.080
Andrew Klobucar: And also, we can see this in some really interesting aesthetic works that point to device six gone home these wonderful walkthrough narratives which do.

94
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:50.010
Andrew Klobucar: provides a model for an aesthetic response to the screen, but I also argue that they might be based, a little bit too much on scriptural documentation and its relationship to the scriptural upon me and scriptural knowledge systems.

95
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.180
Andrew Klobucar: So what can we.

96
00:14:51.720 --> 00:15:00.630
Andrew Klobucar: Make of that now the key attributes that we've seen in a lot of these panels and discussions that go forward in terms of.

97
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.980
Andrew Klobucar: The.

98
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:21.720
Andrew Klobucar: postscript fuel economy is that it, it is open, it is transitory it is impermanent and also it's non referential, and this is very, very key here, even traveler Scott, we can see that in some of his lyrics and we see that also.

99
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.160
Andrew Klobucar: In terms of.

100
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:38.640
Andrew Klobucar: What the battle royale systems are arguing for we don't need to be in the world, the avatars function extremely well and they're non referential they're not referencing us, they are their own entities.

101
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:54.210
Andrew Klobucar: This is something we can actually celebrate because it's a freeing of sorts, but again once we become avatars in these systems, our data is 100% minus we are in fact being surveilled.

102
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:10.140
Andrew Klobucar: So we have this digital walk through an open different kind of open field, perhaps an open mind craft field and that's one model through it.

103
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:27.750
Andrew Klobucar: I just want to sort of move forward with my own perspective on well, we might find a few interesting ideas kind of paradoxically in terms of this this new type of.

104
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:38.400
Andrew Klobucar: aesthetic response so i'm going to take us out of the screen and offer a little bit of aesthetic distance and this is something that I think will pick up in carol's.

105
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:55.350
Andrew Klobucar: excellent paper on a static distance, it is a place of exile, it is an aesthetic response, but of course it didn't happen really on screen at all, and this was an example, this is an interactive.

106
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.720
Andrew Klobucar: type of.

107
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:17.430
Andrew Klobucar: Performance sculpture, where we were asked, and we are asked in all of his projects to be in fact part of this kind of monument the one that I want to draw attention to hear the war for all together, but the most recent one was in 2014.

108
00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.370
Andrew Klobucar: by the Swiss artists.

109
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.360
Thomas hirshhorn.

110
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.010
Andrew Klobucar: monument performance sculpture, he calls the Gramsci.

111
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:36.030
Andrew Klobucar: monument, and this is the fourth and final in a series that he had been doing for some time now they're all named after prominent.

112
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:45.300
Andrew Klobucar: philosophers of the 20th century Espinosa to lose the tie was his third one and Gramsci his fourth one.

113
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.760
Andrew Klobucar: I want to offer it as a model for a kennelly reimagined.

114
00:17:52.110 --> 00:18:12.900
Andrew Klobucar: position of aesthetic distance that does actually bring up some of the same questions about the postscript fuel economy and the knowledge system we're in this is his monument that he produced in the south bronx in the summer of 2014 actually installed in the middle of a public project.

115
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.580
Andrew Klobucar: So what did it look like well when you walked in.

116
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.380
Andrew Klobucar: It was in fact.

117
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.440
Andrew Klobucar: A very, very fascinating place it looked like.

118
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:37.020
Andrew Klobucar: A kind of tree house that had been put up spontaneously and one afternoon, but in fact it was a reimagined Community community as an artwork none of these community.

119
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:48.810
Andrew Klobucar: places or locations that he actually created were considered to be permanent, and yet when you were in it, much like.

120
00:18:49.890 --> 00:19:01.860
Andrew Klobucar: When you're in a kind of screen environment like a fortnight environment, you can do anything you could walk around the world daily programs have lectures on Gramsci.

121
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:12.960
Andrew Klobucar: It had a library of books on Gramsci it had its own theater platform that's kind of a platform within a platform that he called the grim she theater.

122
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:28.920
Andrew Klobucar: And the workplace inside this other artwork so you sat down and you actually for a while, for a very long, while you felt as if you were part of an actual audience watching an actual play and you were.

123
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:38.730
Andrew Klobucar: Little poetry elections lectures on the same stage writing workshops even our workshops that are short himself lead in this exhibition pace place.

124
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:53.910
Andrew Klobucar: um and then just as quickly as it emerged it disappeared and in mid September to 15 he took everything down and all the people who have participated okay.

125
00:19:54.450 --> 00:20:01.710
Andrew Klobucar: was suddenly back in a project and you experienced this profound confusion like well, what do we do now.

126
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:20.730
Andrew Klobucar: When you ask critics, or you ask people who actually participated in it, they all call it a complete failure because the Community that was supposed to evolve, he thought we thought didn't and in fact the theater didn't go on the bar didn't continue.

127
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:27.570
Andrew Klobucar: Many people in fact now don't even remember it because it was going to be seven years ago now.

128
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.440
Andrew Klobucar: So they were able to go back to the project and live their life as it was.

129
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.550
Andrew Klobucar: As a definitely an economically disadvantaged community and the middle of New York City.

130
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:54.270
Andrew Klobucar: And when you asked her short well, what did you want for this all he says is I didn't want anything I just wanted people to play and actually be friends for a little bit.

131
00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:08.430
Andrew Klobucar: And if the friendships and the relationships don't continue that's part of the work itself so people do feel this incredible sense of exile and, in fact, what I remember about it is this strange sort of.

132
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:21.990
Andrew Klobucar: discontinuity when you're walking around it and I do call it an aesthetic success because it raised that issue in me and at the same time I couldn't be immersed in it that was good, he didn't want that.

133
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:32.190
Andrew Klobucar: And it's a political failure, which I think is definitely something we're also looking for in aesthetic exiles.

134
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:41.940
Andrew Klobucar: And as a contradiction to and I won't go into, of course, Graham she would Graham she moved into it just for time but.

135
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:53.430
Andrew Klobucar: He does also talk about a space of exile from this organic arrangement, so it was freeing I think her stone would say, Graham she would say this is, this is the laboratory moment.

136
00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:08.880
Andrew Klobucar: I also want to compare it to another kind of a political success at the moment and aesthetic failure in many ways, because they didn't doesn't want to be aesthetic and wants to be political, and this is the carbon would.

137
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:19.200
Andrew Klobucar: engagement that we see happening now in West oakland underneath a freeway where people who have been homeless, especially in the pandemic.

138
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:32.610
Andrew Klobucar: decided to get together, while maintaining social distance for this past year or so and they've actually built a functioning community with many of the same structures that we saw the aesthetic.

139
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:44.700
Andrew Klobucar: situation, but it is supposed to stay it's supposed to be an aesthetic failure and at the same time, a political success and we get.

140
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:57.030
Andrew Klobucar: free food we get a way of maintaining relationships, but also a moment of consensus, and with that all on move on stopping we can move on to the next panel.

141
00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.490
Andrew Klobucar: Paper Thank you.

142
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:03.600
Kirill Azernyi: Thank you.

143
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.330
Kirill Azernyi: So, if anyone wants to be the next.

144
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.400
Kirill Azernyi: Please do i'm about to take the floor.

145
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.500
Kirill Azernyi: Good all right Thank you everyone.

146
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.360
Kirill Azernyi: Actually.

147
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:36.600
Kirill Azernyi: sperry I find it very comfortable to go after Andrew because I was going to raise the question a little bit.

148
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:43.740
Kirill Azernyi: What actually makes the identity open open structure and all the work.

149
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.210
Kirill Azernyi: Because.

150
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.100
Kirill Azernyi: The way I see it, is that actually.

151
00:23:51.450 --> 00:24:05.970
Kirill Azernyi: been thinking for a while, from the interview process over say traditional aesthetics, which is like old fashioned and county on and dates back to Aquinas, and so on, but.

152
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:13.860
Kirill Azernyi: He says that it still works, because we're still kind of distance from.

153
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:27.990
Kirill Azernyi: A from a from an artifact because there are certain inertia of your decides that says that we are about to be distanced when we approach, an artifact it.

154
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.580
Kirill Azernyi: For very simple reason.

155
00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:42.990
Kirill Azernyi: Because actually the effect ascetics is not quite reality, but it's a mode of perception okay like.

156
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:54.660
Kirill Azernyi: When we think of an object that isn't a static object, and I believe Andrew has shown it perfectly well just he says open static trailer or.

157
00:24:55.290 --> 00:25:05.790
Kirill Azernyi: settings success against political failure or success, which means that well this object can be both or either either a.

158
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:31.080
Kirill Azernyi: Political or or that is so, it means that it's not quite only anesthetics objects up quite an object statics Okay, but it's a mode of aesthetics that can be either turned on or turned off, so to say yes it's pretty it's pretty rough to say that because it perhaps.

159
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:42.660
Kirill Azernyi: Some there is some range of other decisions it's not it doesn't have to be like that, like now i'm looking at a picture from one to view.

160
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:49.920
Kirill Azernyi: Of a viewer and the next day i'm bankrupt and i'm selling it on the market.

161
00:25:50.940 --> 00:26:00.720
Kirill Azernyi: It doesn't have to be your legs that we always we always scale this, and this is what i'm going to talk about scaling of distance.

162
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.610
Kirill Azernyi: and

163
00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:17.940
Kirill Azernyi: In fact, what i'm talking about for now is that it's a certain mode of perception and we do need this mode of perception was being needing this mode perception for a while, because.

164
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.240
Kirill Azernyi: Otherwise we wouldn't be.

165
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.520
Kirill Azernyi: able to.

166
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.370
Kirill Azernyi: Take a proper seats any now the tutorial okay like.

167
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:37.650
Kirill Azernyi: When there is the picture on the wall, we shall also have a seat in the audience too.

168
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:50.250
Kirill Azernyi: Young to you know not let us touch it and so on, then, to protect the picture from from us right, because who knows what we might think we showed you with this.

169
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:59.850
Kirill Azernyi: The aesthetics, the county anesthetic says you're just something he doesn't say that you know this artist of cannot be used to.

170
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:09.540
Kirill Azernyi: Any other way it doesn't say that it cannot be used in any other way says it shouldn't be any other way, he says, you shall he does interest.

171
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:22.020
Kirill Azernyi: Interested right in this because it's not for you to eat some for you to break is a future touches for you to observe to perceive aesthetically from a particular position.

172
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:39.240
Kirill Azernyi: And, to my mind, so I refer to our home really on a lot of the panels I create monthly I I keep saying that there is that guy or number Leon okay well where's the fraternity.

173
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:52.350
Kirill Azernyi: wear a size color a marvelous score athlete who says that county and aesthetics, is not an option, because we've we have.

174
00:27:53.070 --> 00:28:11.130
Kirill Azernyi: performances of in you hero, we have happening, and so on and so forth, and he says now come in aesthetics anymore, because we're 100% involved, but the very fact that is he is constantly in his book art.

175
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.830
Kirill Azernyi: yeah second.

176
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:27.420
Kirill Azernyi: argument argument engagements and way back no mind, he is reading on the view aesthetics of involvement like we are also participating in acts in the work of are.

177
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:34.710
Kirill Azernyi: We looking at it so on, and on Washington he keeps saying that we're not supposed to be.

178
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:49.710
Kirill Azernyi: The viewers anymore, and this means that he still hot he's always highlighting that besides that it's expressing the county and aesthetics is still with us and the means of perception using the digital art.

179
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.340
Kirill Azernyi: Well, these.

180
00:28:54.450 --> 00:29:15.870
Kirill Azernyi: expressive tools are well they're often from the previous days, and when we look at them and actually, for instance, we can find it a lot of references to who knows modernism and it's good read books book who tonic literature, or he says we.

181
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.110
Kirill Azernyi: are rooted in modern, so we are waiting in the distance.

182
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:32.880
Kirill Azernyi: Because modernism is rooted in the in the earlier ages and and I don't believe we need to actually.

183
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:46.980
Kirill Azernyi: proceed in breaking this distance because to me it's kind of productive, first of all, because as Andrew has noted the open structure doesn't give us any particular.

184
00:29:47.550 --> 00:30:00.960
Kirill Azernyi: target right and, in particular, in particular goal, so what is freedom, freedom is that I am in search of myself okay in way certain kind of help, because it means that I cannot.

185
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:09.330
Kirill Azernyi: structure my own identity, two words a piece of art and this problem is.

186
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:32.250
Kirill Azernyi: is not present in the traditional arts kits that we are presented asset viewers identity and the art the the artifact is presented as the identity open artifact and it's it is all made possible through the relations through the distance between me and.

187
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.890
Kirill Azernyi: So, it means that everything.

188
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:57.900
Kirill Azernyi: most interesting has already happens, I have already been found and the our fact has already been founded Okay, so this is the structure and this structure is 100% determines by itself, and when we are watching, for instance, a film, we do not.

189
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.810
Kirill Azernyi: Follow the steps of.

190
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:19.050
Kirill Azernyi: The camera as if it was spontaneous so we can say that each previous step is backed by the future staffs Okay, so this structure is first of all finished says infinity.

191
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:43.200
Kirill Azernyi: What the completeness of an artifact is watch actually distances us from that were not a part of it, because it's complete already it doesn't need us because Jesus complete already so once we have these open structure questions starting started for you to my mind right and.

192
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.880
Kirill Azernyi: there's a problem that arises from derived from it, the problem is that.

193
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.370
Kirill Azernyi: We do not.

194
00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:03.900
Kirill Azernyi: We are incapable our opening capable to identify an object in the process of it's becoming because we're used to.

195
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:13.290
Kirill Azernyi: presuppose that our artistic attitude when we are answering a gallery Okay, are we are an info when we have we're entering a museum.

196
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:35.850
Kirill Azernyi: Somewhere or when we're opening a no vote we have presuppose attitude towards it, so it means that if i'm not sure it's a no i'm not sure if i'm a reader or not, so if it's not and know, am I am eager again to go beyond our little bit okay.

197
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:53.010
Kirill Azernyi: yeah that you refer two seasons object and her booth cold devoted to the old photographs of suffering people where he actually says that you see these pictures are.

198
00:32:54.420 --> 00:33:13.200
Kirill Azernyi: owns well enough it doesn't mean that they're very good about their adjusted, I mean the artists themselves the artists right before the photographers themselves treat Z or object their documentaries, as well the humanity photos right, so they are.

199
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:21.030
Kirill Azernyi: For a job of saying, sometimes things that are unbearable but.

200
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:43.620
Kirill Azernyi: Also, they act as if we were artists right they're not the eyes of the artists to be the adjust things okay to make them more creatively effective you say this is what song song job sasa Okay, so what she says is that even.

201
00:33:44.640 --> 00:34:00.900
Kirill Azernyi: When we're looking at something very, very serious and Lisa and tragic sometimes we're incapable to treat it as if it was reality okay like she says the photographers actresses they were artists okay.

202
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:20.790
Kirill Azernyi: And this means that this frame of completeness, is very, very much imposing and it's it's necessary for us to identify that Well, this is an audio check and so on, so this is the big picture, the big picture is the context of guy like.

203
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.190
Kirill Azernyi: This is what, for instance.

204
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:36.180
Kirill Azernyi: An art critic and philosopher value polsky CSC have here actually the first term, the more you open when he says when we're looking at a face, for instance, again, what would be on art we're looking at his face.

205
00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:46.020
Kirill Azernyi: The first of all see a face, we see a person, and then we started discerning his or her particular features okay their particular features off.

206
00:34:46.620 --> 00:35:03.360
Kirill Azernyi: The face of God it doesn't work like you know is if I am looking at and knows i'm looking at that one i'm going to die, and then I will produce a face in my mind revision doesn't happen like that and.

207
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.310
Kirill Azernyi: The article.

208
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.490
Kirill Azernyi: Which is no to which was named.

209
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:21.930
Kirill Azernyi: Something like they they recognized him and they stopped seeing the person as far as I remember it was about it was religious i'm i'm not sure if a sermon was.

210
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:30.540
Kirill Azernyi: So, it means that recognition loses well, let me read something we lose all the details Okay, so there was a big picture.

211
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:44.100
Kirill Azernyi: So, but there was also something sure like what if we do not know what it is, what if we are not sure it's no wonder we're not sure if it's a piece of what we have to move, step by step.

212
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:57.810
Kirill Azernyi: Okay run into things stumble, and so one and it doesn't guarantee that we will any way gain, we will have things big picture, because.

213
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:04.260
Kirill Azernyi: The big picture is already with us, we actually don't have to reproduce the big official through.

214
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:19.500
Kirill Azernyi: The small steps we don't have to do this because our big picture, what we expect ourselves with this is, in our tradition in our candy mission of distance, so we see that the building and we.

215
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.660
Kirill Azernyi: were looking around building yeah Okay, so we are.

216
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.580
Kirill Azernyi: stumbling and we were running.

217
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:46.740
Kirill Azernyi: around in the furniture and so on, and it might be uncomfortable, but we are keeping the big picture of the House in our in our mind, so this is a really tricky thing.

218
00:36:48.060 --> 00:37:00.360
Kirill Azernyi: was actually yeah, the question is what makes these two pictures unified in court incorporates users experience right because, in fact.

219
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:19.710
Kirill Azernyi: This is, I believe, very serious in terms of users identity, because we lose us we actually are distance from ourselves like I have just solve the Repo for instance right, and I can read the ISP and I have been before.

220
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:31.050
Kirill Azernyi: But what is my attitude towards my decision Doris what I have just done, I am distance from myself so they're very disruptive identity of the user.

221
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:47.820
Kirill Azernyi: A split identity over user, which is maintained by a form that is being revealed that is in process of revealing revealing correct okay so i'm not sure if.

222
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.190
Kirill Azernyi: How much time do I have.

223
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.180
Kirill Azernyi: A little bit.

224
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.170
Kirill Azernyi: Okay, yes, so i'm going to show you.

225
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.920
Kirill Azernyi: Something i'm working on because.

226
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:13.920
Kirill Azernyi: This is actually totally devoted to one I am talking about, so, in fact, what i've done here is only for you to look at because.

227
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:29.310
Kirill Azernyi: it's very raw and there is that person, but it is kind of illustrates what i'm talking about, so we have a big picture of syntax and grammar and we have a small picture of attaching things to each other to thing.

228
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:44.460
Kirill Azernyi: You know, proper a proper story that's right so bad when i'm doing this is OK, but when i'm doing this is not Okay, so you are is dramatically better, but it is.

229
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.200
Kirill Azernyi: is easier to do so, we have what it is.

230
00:38:50.370 --> 00:39:01.560
Kirill Azernyi: And we have what I do and what I do contradicts what it is, because I cannot easily attach easily a fashionable things let's.

231
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.730
Kirill Azernyi: move further a little bit, so I have another.

232
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:16.050
Kirill Azernyi: yeah but the energy to make it look better and to look even worse, so this is OK, but when I do this.

233
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:29.040
Kirill Azernyi: I experiencing problems, so, in fact, this is, and it goes like that and it's it's traits and the more you try to make the text coherence.

234
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:41.070
Kirill Azernyi: And, the harder it becomes to do this technically configure because, if I want to choose this thing because, like that.

235
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:56.250
Kirill Azernyi: And more and more constraints, if you want to make a text go here and because what it is always contradicts what we do, and this is how we stumble and adjust our behavior.

236
00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:11.340
Kirill Azernyi: So this is what I was going to gel and I wanted to conclude with the reference to small different reference to see one dog, who says that a child, when he or she is.

237
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:18.120
Kirill Azernyi: about to start walking normally I guess how to you know how to crawl.

238
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:35.640
Kirill Azernyi: Because that we need to stumble to proceed moving forward okay so it's a complicated switching between what it is and what we do.

239
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.750
Kirill Azernyi: Okay, so this is pretty much it Thank you.

240
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.240
Kate T: Rebecca is going to present next.

241
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.170
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Thank you, Kate and let me just see if I can share my screen.

242
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.020
See.

243
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.780
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: I hope that's coming through okay to folks.

244
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:22.110
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Thank you so much, Kate and Andrew and kill for inviting me to join you it's really a pleasure to be in conversation.

245
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.810
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: hi i'm Rebecca rouse i'm a.

246
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.880
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Professor at university, who have done in Sweden.

247
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:32.490
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And i'm going to share a little bit about dream time pandemic time and platform problems.

248
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:40.350
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: i'm going to open with this anecdote here's a copy of an email, I sent to my colleague Bobby Schweizer last month, so I.

249
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:51.660
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: I couldn't find a research paper that I had a thought I found through a Google scholar search but, but the embarrassing part is I wasn't sure if this was a dream or not I have been having these.

250
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:59.760
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Google scholar search dreams lately, the very realistic, so I reached out to Bobby to ask if he knew about the paper, I was looking for and.

251
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:09.480
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Okay, it turns out, it was a dream i've been having these highly realistic continuation of Google scholar search flow in my dreams i'll come back to this.

252
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:23.790
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Time is a key component of flow and famously theorized by my hayley hayley and when we're engaged in flow he points out, we may lose all sense of time.

253
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:34.650
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Jay bolter has discussed like the aesthetic of cathartic, unlike the aesthetic of catharsis you know bolter has made the distinction between catharsis and flow.

254
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:46.350
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: catharsis moving moving to its own depletion and resolution but flow, on the other hand, having no end so we can never scroll to the end of Twitter, in the same way, we could turn the final page of a book.

255
00:42:46.920 --> 00:43:03.420
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Of course Twitter provides us with an interactive narrative platform and network access in a way that the contemporary mass produced codecs can't but what has the experience of time during pandemic time revealed about the differences between scrolling and page turning.

256
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:10.140
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Time has behave very differently, for me, in these past months, when, like many of you have been confined to my home.

257
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:18.150
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Without these spatial mnemonic markers of time passing you know, like I used to have like drive to town to go to work walk down to the cafeteria for lunch.

258
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.640
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Today, could be a year ago today could be yesterday you know today could just as easily be tomorrow.

259
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:34.920
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Despite all that, the digital realm of so called real time has continued and i'm grateful for that right because that's how we can meet here, unable to keep my job during this catastrophe.

260
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:44.460
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But in my experience, it turns out that real time for me might not refer to human lived reality at all, but rather to the reality of the machine.

261
00:43:45.090 --> 00:44:00.120
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: The real time of zoom does become exhausting after enough hours right, I found the flow saturated interactions of social media have become tiresome even more quickly and what used to feel like a pleasurable break from other word paced activities now don't boring.

262
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:11.190
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Even writing for work on the computer has become less of a norm for me i'm writing on paper again a lot now now that so much other work of teaching and meetings is all happening in the zoom room.

263
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:25.740
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And paper has a very different time flow experience quality right you're writing separate words and pause the express devotee of handwriting the feel of the paper here, maybe i'll try a different pen today, but the keyboard clicks are always all the same.

264
00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:36.450
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: The flow today that feels most pleasurable to me is less about interaction with a machine and more about interaction between people like collaborating with our secure six year old son.

265
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:45.570
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: To make an edit songs and garage band, we lose track of time we make our own fun and this flow is between us and co created experience.

266
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:53.400
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So maybe real time actually means machine time and maybe machine time brings us into machine flow.

267
00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:09.630
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: By encouraging our basic human tendencies towards my niece's transforming us into code, such that we absorb the platforms, maybe even into our own dream time like i've managed to to so maybe maybe real time, after all, though, began long before the digital medium.

268
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:17.280
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: With black box machines operated by digits like these digits that provided instant response, as in the piano.

269
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:26.880
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And yet, when I played the piano I fill our tiny house with music I contribute creative expression after i've practiced mastered the peace.

270
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:35.040
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: No matter how much I practice Twitter, it will never fill our House with music, I will never mastered as a creative partner, it will never respond to me as a creative partner.

271
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:43.170
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So if we think about so called real time as machine time how might we describe human produced time perhaps as dialogue time.

272
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:54.210
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: i've been working with inner group dialogue as a pedagogical method with my colleague amy caron at rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the past several years and in our research project to transform.

273
00:45:54.810 --> 00:46:01.890
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: We game design course through a critical feminist lens we've used dialogic pedagogy in the classroom context.

274
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:10.170
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: dialogue as a communication platform has a particular texture that differentiates it from other forms of communication platforms, such as discussion or debate.

275
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:15.540
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Now different is not better but different platforms do lead to different outcomes.

276
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:23.610
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: In a dialogue based class we begin the process by talking about dialogue, so we surface the platform itself the platform is made visible.

277
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:35.910
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: We talk about why we choose this communication mode why our goals align with what dialogue makes possible we co author guidelines for how we want the dialogue to proceed these guidelines are revisited at each class meeting and they're up for editing.

278
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:48.630
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: We keep them in play it's playful we co create the platform keep it in this state of continual revision and these there are a lot of connections here with playing games, but dialogue is more like play and less like a game.

279
00:46:49.530 --> 00:47:05.790
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: The method of formalized co constituted dialogue has very different aims from those of debate which you can see laid out here Persuasion is not a goal of dialogue goals are more transformative than that and they're focused on specific practices enacted within the dialogue.

280
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:15.480
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Dialogue has this potential to be transformative in ways discussion and debate can't and let me emphasize potential, though, because there are no guarantees.

281
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:22.980
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So we can guarantee, in a debate, there will be a winner, we can guarantee in a discussion that a range of points of view will be presented.

282
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.360
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: In a dialogue, however we're on an adventure together but off the map.

283
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:36.570
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Because we are drawing our own map as we go like crockett johnson's Harold in the purple crayon creating his world in real time, or rather in human time.

284
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:48.960
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Human time creates its own markers of progress as as Harold does with the moon, time is the time, the human perceives as the human perceives it and Harold perceive the moon moving with him.

285
00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:59.280
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: In dialogue we're co creating our platform for communication, even as we use it we're making the world within between the world and each other, which in relation makes us.

286
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:07.380
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And what kind of world are we living in today drawing parallels between the current political, cultural and economic moment in the US today.

287
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:14.730
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And the night end of the 19th century gilded age certainly feels natural i'm not the only one to make these comparisons.

288
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:23.880
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: In looking back at the history of that first gilded age I recognize very similar politics of obstruction economic and social inequality corruption.

289
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:32.940
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: The remarkable agency and power of a corporate and money to leap in our second gilded age, today I am anxious to understand how I may be taking part.

290
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:46.170
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: As an academic and games and immersive media big business of prior ages like cotton, tobacco that did not operate in the public interest were able to draw on the scholarship of some academics for support.

291
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:54.450
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: What is the relationship between big tech today and the Academy, and I think in the increasingly corporate as University of seems ties, maybe closer than ever.

292
00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:03.960
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Well, some have called big data, the new oil which we might understand his successor to cotton, tobacco, others have described data in far more human terms.

293
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:13.800
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Legal scholar john Balkan rights, data is soylent Green, you are your data and that data is the raw material digital capitalism.

294
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:29.040
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: platforms, such as Twitter or Facebook and spotify are not created for the public good, to support free speech or Community connection or creative expression, the platforms are created to harvest and monetize data developed through users free Labor as we consume each other.

295
00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:39.810
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Trying to examine these soylent green style platforms, that the level of code it's clear the platforms are not optimized for human literacy, but for machine literacy.

296
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:46.020
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: and ask for good reasons, so the the sheer scale of the data generated and collected by these platforms.

297
00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:53.610
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: a scale that is key for the platform is revenue model necessitates machine based processing and interpretation of the data.

298
00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:05.610
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: The machine literacy doesn't always lead to the outcomes, we might expect so Examples of this include facebook's monitoring of user activity which also generates data showing when you're asleep.

299
00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:16.770
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And spotify is recent patent for audio monitoring of users and their environments to determine users age, gender, accent emotional state.

300
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.420
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Details of the users physical environment, including if they're alone or not.

301
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:34.560
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Reading this spotify patent is particularly instructive in the ways in which these platforms are developed for machine literacy and the ways in which we, the human users are then rendered visible to that type of literacy.

302
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:53.370
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And so, while I think that mathematics ization of identity, culture and emotion in this patent is both odious and laughable the the line of code shared in the patent that disturbed me the most was on the bottom right there keyword alone confidence 87% so spa defies.

303
00:50:54.420 --> 00:51:00.930
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: taste attribute identification system will know where I am and if i'm alone or not some level of confidence.

304
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:13.200
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But I suppose I would never truly be alone because I will be always accompanied by the taste attribution identification system, just as Facebook users are still with Facebook, in a sense, even when they're sleeping.

305
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:31.020
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So in dreams, while we might not be surveilled yet others may have like me absorbed the platform and continue their Google scholar search patterns and dream time, so perhaps in in the dream time gig economy even the time of suppose and rest for the brain and body can be put to work.

306
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:39.660
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: As a scholars working in the same computational medium, we must ask how does our work in games interactive narrative and digital storytelling.

307
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:54.090
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Potentially already being subverted to the interest of the powerful and the few how how might the work we're doing not be the work we think we're doing how how might we also be buying into the world building activity activities of big tech and what can be done about it.

308
00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:01.380
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: One trap, we could aim to avoid is the trap of seeking technological solutions when human solutions are better.

309
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:10.290
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So, for example, the drive to develop immersive empathy machines and vr to ease social inequality, when we already have the technology of human to human dialogue.

310
00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:19.170
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: We could also avoid the drive to create interactive narrative systems that better model complexity, when we already have the technologies that artistic and creative expression.

311
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:25.020
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: That can illuminate so called wicked problems in profound ways that do not erase the human or the particular.

312
00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:35.850
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So the technological solutions promise speed efficiency mass adoption profit and align with funding sources, like the many large government grants to prioritize technology.

313
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:44.250
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But even when our aims as academic researchers may be to work toward justice when we work within these ontology and structures, sometimes the work we're doing.

314
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.600
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: may not be the work we think we're.

315
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.990
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: doing and I think gamification is an interesting example of this.

316
00:52:50.190 --> 00:53:00.180
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: philosopher see time when has written about how this shows up on Twitter with the platforms gamification of communication gamification motivates via procedural ization.

317
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:13.560
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Like points giving points but procedure realities homogenising effects are intensified by the rigidity of the digital medium so in a in an in person or physical interaction if we choose to add gamification elements.

318
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:19.290
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: We also then have agency to shatter transform them as needed like Harold and the purple cram.

319
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:30.930
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But this is not the case in many digital platforms, with the digital platform, the procedural ization of user motivation can even then lead to a simplification of our interactions.

320
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:40.170
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: between each other so they're rendered machine legible and, over time, even can transform our aims of what we even intended to be doing on that platform in the first place.

321
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:48.090
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: to fit into that narrowness simplicity and sameness and since gamification is designed for the transference of skills.

322
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:54.660
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Once we learn these more narrow aims and motivations, we may also take them out into the rest of our lives.

323
00:53:54.990 --> 00:54:07.200
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Where the thirst for extrinsic motivation that's what gamification essentially is extrinsic motivation may keep pinging us internally like phone notifications pinion and pants pocket but inside of ourselves.

324
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:17.730
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So what can we do, I suggest we choose to configure design processes and practices to slow down and complexity, the design process rather than simplify it.

325
00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:25.410
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Work to remove extrinsic motivations in favor of intrinsic ones i've written elsewhere about a design method based in the values of human dialogue.

326
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:31.350
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: As opposed to media simulation as particularly suited for developing meaningful design work in in with communities.

327
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:42.510
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: That this kind of design process is really slow, I mean it's extremely slow the steps outlined in that chapter take years to complete like three or four years, and it could never fit in a two week design sprint.

328
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:51.390
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: We can also take some of what we do in the digital and play with it more flexible media that are easier to attune to human time like paper.

329
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.430
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: working to mind the afforded says have more flexible, media and playful ways so here's some.

330
00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:03.240
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: background video from an interactive narrative book project of mine it's ongoing it's an experimental documentation project.

331
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:08.700
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: With this international research group that's focused on paper called paper ology it's run out of university of Montreal.

332
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:18.930
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And I created this initial handmade book as a substrate for others inscriptions and contributions it's currently being shipped around the world to the other members of the group it's been going since January.

333
00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:31.530
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: we're only about a quarter way through the list of people who want to contribute to it, so it may finish in another year and a half, but that's a very different time scale for for an interactive narrative project right couple years.

334
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:42.270
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: I think i'll end with this last anecdote to point towards another possible way into forward in terms of thinking about games play time.

335
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:52.530
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: The human and complicity so since we moved a year ago from New York my mother and I now live oceans apart so her in New York and me and Sweden.

336
00:55:52.890 --> 00:56:06.090
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: And since we can't travel to see each other during the pandemic our dialogues are now all on zoom signal and email, I mean occasionally we send handwritten notes, but the the mail systems are so bad in both our countries can take even a month to receive them.

337
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:17.970
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But earlier this week, she shared an article with me on email on the use of robotic pets as a loneliness intervention for elderly people and many US States and this article is full of hope.

338
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:30.000
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: It shares the good news that lonely people can meaningfully bond with robots and experience relief from feelings of despair, there are ethical concerns mentioned in the article, including the worry that people who enjoy.

339
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.870
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: robotic care may come to prefer to human care.

340
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:44.190
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Researchers and cysts though the robot pets are not toys in there, and some of the people interviewed in the article but exclamation marks, these are not toys, they insist.

341
00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:51.990
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: In spite of the meaningful playful relationships, the owners developed with them, but I think this is actually a terrible misunderstanding of what a toy is.

342
00:56:52.530 --> 00:57:00.480
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: observe a child playing with a toy you see that a toy is not a frivolous or silly object, it is a deeply meaningful creative way.

343
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:11.100
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: of externalising this self Okay, not in the manner of the spotify code that mathematicians as human emotion, but through physical tactical and creative human processing.

344
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:22.080
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: there's a creepy side to robots that's for sure you know, they could be abused for surveillance, obviously, for one, but I think there's much we could learn from these robot kittens actually about how the capacity to play.

345
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:31.530
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: can keep us vital at any age nevertheless after reading that article about the robot cats i'm left thinking about how we managed to construct.

346
00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:48.150
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Our society, such that so many of our elders are alone, and here too i'm complicit 3900 miles away from my parents, but I look forward to continuing the dialogue with my mom on our next zoom we won't find an answer, but we will continue to connect.

347
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:49.950
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Thank you.

348
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.570
Kate T: Thank you Rebecca I love it.

349
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:04.770
Kate T: I love ridiculous robots so I really appreciate you putting on that image.

350
00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:11.640
Kate T: And maybe that's a good segue to my presentation, because I left myself to start on is that what i'm interested.

351
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:28.230
Kate T: or critique so I like the associate social connections between robot cats and humans also interested in how a narrative becomes the result of both a platform, but also the.

352
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:39.030
Kate T: Supposedly well or purportedly well studied social phenomena this this question is what drew and I, together and made us want to organize today's panel.

353
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:52.050
Kate T: Personally i'm also really interested in knowledge and meaning making, and so what I want to talk to you about today's Q and on and on, seemed like the perfect object to explore all of these different themes.

354
00:58:54.600 --> 00:59:04.980
Kate T: I what I propose is that the best way to analyze Q and on is as an interactive narrative, in contrast to what is it much more common claim that's okay.

355
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:18.270
Kate T: I think that narrative that is important, especially the fact that it has collaborated on is key to understanding what went on is and why it matters so First let me tell you a little bit about.

356
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:29.370
Kate T: The kind of mainstream understanding of two and on cue is a person it's a nickname for an online user claims to be closely connected to.

357
00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:39.780
Kate T: Donald trump few posts cryptic messages online that allude to a massive government conspiracy covering up a whole range of atrocities, including a cabal of how to fill up.

358
00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:50.550
Kate T: Politicians and and she suggests the trump is going to eventually save the world from all the problems that he outlines, he is a master pretty substantial following online, in fact.

359
00:59:51.180 --> 01:00:07.830
Kate T: Just this morning I was googling for something related to this presentation and one of the research came out just yesterday, showing that somewhere between 15 and 20% of the US population believes the basic maths the Q is laid out which isn't really frightening number to me.

360
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.390
Kate T: After Q starting to drop hosting what he calls what what is always call us drops.

361
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:23.100
Kate T: is ultimately lead to a loose movement amongst followers spread across all kinds of social media it started on somewhat.

362
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:37.320
Kate T: fringe semi fringe social media sites like for channel eight channel, but ultimately sprint all mainstream social media as well as a number of novel right wing social media sites on sites invented pretty much for this purpose.

363
01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:47.070
Kate T: So what So what do these people do, what do all of these followers do the majority of Q amp accuse adherence.

364
01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:58.020
Kate T: Followers get their information from an interpreter so not from you directly, although Q has been directly communicating with people on social media since the beginning.

365
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:08.310
Kate T: Most of his followers turn to other followers to explain his cryptic posts and so i'm.

366
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.510
Kate T: Sorry he's cryptic posts are consistent primarily of questions so he might post.

367
01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:27.570
Kate T: Two brief sentences barely containing any information and then two to four questions intended to lead people to some sort of a conclusion, and I would suggest also.

368
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:36.540
Kate T: Maybe not intended towards any particularly strong conclusion because the benefit for this person trying to develop a following.

369
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:47.430
Kate T: Is that people can answer his questions, however, they want to have a role, keep them the most engaged to himself doesn't have to do most of the work to engage his followers.

370
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:57.780
Kate T: there's a whole industry of these folks these interpreters people who've made people who made public identities for themselves out of interpreting these drops.

371
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:05.400
Kate T: But the people who get their information from these interpreters, the drops probably wouldn't be compelling on their own and the drops are.

372
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:18.840
Kate T: What we would call a text or an object of analysis, but they are so they are interesting for us as an analyst but for his followers there for most of his followers they're impenetrable.

373
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:29.220
Kate T: Both of these groups, the the bulk of the followers and the interpreters they meet each other, the interpreters need an audience and a reason to provide these interpretations.

374
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:40.920
Kate T: And these followers or second degree followers as one name i'm considering for them, they need that narrative choose drops wouldn't be compelling for them without the narrative that the interpreters provide.

375
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:50.490
Kate T: Now i'm still on the fence about whether this is what happens with traditional narrative and or traditional interactive narrative.

376
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:58.680
Kate T: I started out by thinking well an author writes in a way intended to be comprehensible, but.

377
01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:07.350
Kate T: Then again, do they leaving something up for interpretation is, of course, often the goal of an artist.

378
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:18.780
Kate T: And, with the advent of the Internet turn to a massive crowd to develop your interpretation to become quite common and for me at least this is my default for how I watch or read any form of entertainment.

379
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:30.240
Kate T: consume it and then immediately check with the Internet things, and so, in many ways, I think that the Q amp a narrative follows more traditional narratives very, very closely.

380
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.640
Kate T: In addition to the facts.

381
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.440
Kate T: One has to work.

382
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.770
Kate T: will derive meaning from the drops is.

383
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:52.380
Kate T: A huge part of what makes the movement so compelling the work itself it's not a static narrative it's not even about.

384
01:03:53.220 --> 01:04:04.080
Kate T: How well crafted the narrative is it's about the user experience the sense of responsibility for the stories production, the feeling that you're building real human connections.

385
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:15.570
Kate T: Even a feeling that the story is something fresh and new in large part because it's being generated live the story is being created in this moment as you're following it.

386
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:20.910
Kate T: So i'm one of the issues that.

387
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.020
Kate T: My fellow panelists have been one of the issues that.

388
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.410
Kate T: we've discussed and it didn't show up as much in the presentations today as I thought it might is the difference between the physical book and the virtual one.

389
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:43.650
Kate T: And i'm still I myself i'm still not clear on if I think this differences meaningful or not, after all, and this is the thing I come up against over and over computers are still material.

390
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:53.970
Kate T: That material looks very different than a paper book, but is the materiality of one really meaningfully different from the other.

391
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:55.950
Kate T: um.

392
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.630
Kate T: I don't think, however, so and so no it's not a however therefore i'm not sure that the electronic interaction.

393
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:16.230
Kate T: is what makes any of what we've talked about today interesting so much as it is the collaboration and especially in the case of my study but in case of all of these.

394
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:26.250
Kate T: I think it is the human connections, it is the fact that we are working together to make meaning and we are working together to consume the story, as well as create the story.

395
01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:27.780
Kate T: That.

396
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:33.930
Kate T: That makes this new literary landscape so interesting.

397
01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.330
Kate T: And the fact that.

398
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:53.580
Kate T: There isn't a virtual capacity of voices telling stories storytelling is no longer beholden to one voice, this is the most compelling elements of the literary landscape, we look at now.

399
01:05:56.130 --> 01:06:07.920
Kate T: Another component of my co presenters work that I wanted to touch on is exile Andrew talked a bit about exile exile is everywhere in the queue and on mo mo movement.

400
01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:17.490
Kate T: There is a strong sense of persecution among followers that you went on by society at large, but there's a really interesting interpersonal.

401
01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:21.120
Kate T: interpersonal elements, contributing to that.

402
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:32.940
Kate T: So we tend to think a little bit more, I would say, structurally or systemically about exile, but in q1 i'm on it is extremely common to be rejected by the people closest to you in your life because.

403
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:43.620
Kate T: The claims made by by this movement are so extremely bold and are not supported by mainstream knowledge and research.

404
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:56.520
Kate T: And so it leaves very readily two divisions and interpersonal relationships if and those people for any one of us, the people closest to us make up a very substantial portion of society, as we experience it.

405
01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:04.800
Kate T: And so rejection by the most substantial element of the society we live in, for adherence of Q of q's.

406
01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:13.800
Kate T: may well be experiencing social rejection for their beliefs, largely because of this very small interpersonal rejection.

407
01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:21.270
Kate T: So, so let me talk for a SEC just for a second about that structurally.

408
01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:22.860
Kate T: um.

409
01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:31.860
Kate T: I think that so exile produces a kind of solidarity.

410
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:47.520
Kate T: I think that Q non adherence initially felt separate from society and then connect to themselves to this movement that affirmed that difference that state of exile so as opposed to.

411
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:54.660
Kate T: feeling exile, because of the group, you belong to these are people who felt exhausted therefore belongs to a group.

412
01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:05.520
Kate T: um alright, so we are tight on time and I apologize for that For those of you who've been following along with the narrative that we've written i'm.

413
01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:19.890
Kate T: Sorry i'm trying to manage as as Dana mentioned in the chat a very large number of channels um I I wish that we had more time to talk about your answers to some of the questions that the narrative posed to you.

414
01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:33.540
Kate T: The goal and including those pressures, the narrative for you is to give you a little bit of an opportunity to play the game and read the story that shoe non followers acumen and adherence.

415
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:56.610
Kate T: play so the style those questions was written very much to mimic choose style of posing a question that seems like the author intended you to come up with a specific answer but it gives you the audience, the opportunity to figure out to play with whether or not you believe the weather.

416
01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:07.980
Kate T: How real that feels to you, so my hope, with the narrative is that initially it felt very real that we all intended you to come up with a clear answer to the questions we asked.

417
01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:23.460
Kate T: And that now, having heard me talk about this a little bit from the inside, it will give you a chance to question that to be skeptical that we had to be skeptical that it was our narrative when in fact it may be your narrative that you were telling yourself.

418
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:36.750
Kate T: Okay, so i'm going to stop there, and ask are there questions for me or for any of the panelists we have about six minutes, there is a 15 minute break afterwards and I don't know how much they're going to wiggle room they'll give us with the.

419
01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:38.490
Kate T: 15 minutes.

420
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:55.800
Andrew Klobucar: Okay, well, thank you, Kate I mean we can certainly continue on with the discussions with the time we have left but there's quite a few really wonderful comments in the chat group i've been sort of following them as they.

421
01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.310
Andrew Klobucar: flow along forward.

422
01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:04.590
Andrew Klobucar: The.

423
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:13.200
Andrew Klobucar: The issue that I find really interesting in the document comes from Rebecca has presentation I don't know if she.

424
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:30.270
Andrew Klobucar: If we could talk a little bit about that, but the paper ology I find fascinating because this is really an attempt to to bring back a document or a scriptural economy which seems a fascinating point of exile.

425
01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:47.400
Andrew Klobucar: In a way, now that we we we we consider it to be a little bit fetishistic in a sense, almost obscene that we would make paper art when when we have such incredibly effective screens.

426
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.370
Kirill Azernyi: Well, can I say something of this.

427
01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.200
Kirill Azernyi: But in fact.

428
01:10:56.850 --> 01:10:58.530
Kirill Azernyi: i've been thinking on is the.

429
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:14.940
Kirill Azernyi: connection between the material culture of writing and the digital culture of writing and it to me, though, the material kosher of writing has been for a while connected with the paper.

430
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:29.160
Kirill Azernyi: that it has been connected with the all kinds of surfaces before and it's still going with those kinds of services actually surface as a again howdy boschi claims like this.

431
01:11:30.030 --> 01:12:01.800
Kirill Azernyi: surface is necessary for the signs to appear, and it cannot help but be material, I mean the material culture won't be tough to with the disappearance of the of the paper Okay, and the digital cultural writing is also, in a way material, so I don't think it's so real.

432
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:15.630
Kirill Azernyi: I don't think it's really about paper I think it's about the science that cannot appear without the material background.

433
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:20.850
Kirill Azernyi: So this is what I wanted to say on this.

434
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.710
Kirill Azernyi: yeah but with the.

435
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:34.020
Kirill Azernyi: Additional much reality is a problem right so visual materiality is present, but it's that.

436
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:56.550
Kirill Azernyi: We will I don't think we will for now understand what it really is what digital reality really is what you see the show much reality that resists and so on, but I do believe that the reality persists edition so.

437
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:12.240
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: I could just that that book project is made for and with a group of researchers that have all been studying paper we've all been studying paper together for a year.

438
01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:27.960
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: From all disciplines, so you know environmental historical scientific material science book history kind of you name it artists and scholars and technologists in the group.

439
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:36.270
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So it's interesting to me to hear Andrew say that it seemed sort of obscene or fetishistic when.

440
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:48.510
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Through that study for a year, I think our group a lot in our group felt paper is just human I mean it's just you know we can have lots of conversations about what paper is where it is what where paper flows how it's made.

441
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:56.160
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But it seems to be really bound up with us, as you know, humans it doesn't seem to go away.

442
01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.320
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Maybe shift.

443
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:09.510
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: So it seems like maybe we should try and engage the materiality of paper in activity in our group together just kind of where the.

444
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:16.830
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Where the project came from, but it's not meant to be like you know precious or something at all actually.

445
01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:39.510
Andrew Klobucar: yeah, but I think that's that's what I find kind of interesting about it and I, and I do think that, even though it's not meant to be fetishistic when we leave what we what we see in in this this progressive shift into the screen is in a way.

446
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:42.180
Andrew Klobucar: The human body and.

447
01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:49.110
Andrew Klobucar: it's it's connections, which I think we're augmented actually in the pandemic with with being a kind of sight.

448
01:14:49.620 --> 01:15:02.910
Andrew Klobucar: Of obscenity or or fetish we want to post a hug each other, we were supposed to stay, apart from each other, we can certainly see that, so I think that's what gives the the paper ology project, a lot of its aesthetic value.

449
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:24.420
Andrew Klobucar: it's it really does seem to be out of the world in the in the study of paper, and I think it would be very, very important to to maintain paper ology as a really interesting site of of study, because it is it's becoming increasingly rare.

450
01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:35.280
Andrew Klobucar: Also economically rare because wood and paper are achieve these incredible prices, I know people who would with work, who work with would.

451
01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:49.110
Andrew Klobucar: Who now had to stop because the price of a single tree went up 10 times during the pandemic it's it becomes a kind of gold.

452
01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:50.970
Andrew Klobucar: More value.

453
01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.590
Kate T: fetishistic is just the word for that, because I was reflecting on.

454
01:15:55.770 --> 01:16:08.700
Kate T: How many businesses insisted on eliminating cash transactions long past the point where there was any reason to think that that's how you transmit coven our own university Andrew on the last day of classes still would not take cash for purchases.

455
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:18.390
Kate T: So there's this incredible you're right that there's this amazing dichotomy this low the hate of the material during the pandemic that's really fascinating.

456
01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:23.610
Andrew Klobucar: yeah I haven't had $1 bill in my wallet for about 14.

457
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.230
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: But I think.

458
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:27.600
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: I bet you have touch paper today.

459
01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:29.520
Kate T: Oh yeah.

460
01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:32.190
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: of some kind of other right because, like toilet paper.

461
01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:38.670
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: household paper there's industrial papers there's the paper of the cardboard box, which is like the calling card of the pandemic.

462
01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:51.840
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: Like I don't think paper actually goes anywhere, I think we it stays with us, but we can debate what is paper like someone could say a cardboard box is not paper, I only mean computer paper okay fine, but if we if we think about paper and paper products more broadly.

463
01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:58.710
Rebecca Rouse - she/her: They aren't rare at all in fact they're so ubiquitous they may seem to be invisible right.

464
01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.900
Alan Sondheim: A present very different relationship to.

465
01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:19.080
Alan Sondheim: History then anything on a computer when when you're through with the computer you recycle is here with best buy or something like that, if you can recycle it then the garbage you know electronic garbage is is kind of deadly.

466
01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:37.200
Alan Sondheim: But I have, I was just thinking of a book that goes back to 1517 and that carries a tremendous history with that can't really be reproduced in any other form and that relates very much to the body, because our bodies likewise.

467
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:50.190
Alan Sondheim: We you know you're talking, we can talk about the body, if a book body of text the human body and so forth that's very different than the things that seem to laterally slide on one screen or another.

468
01:17:52.080 --> 01:18:00.150
Kate T: Thank you Ellen I apologize for not addressing that comment, a little further where i'm getting some pressure from the conference organizers to wrap up since we are past our time slot year.

469
01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:11.520
