19
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:36.240
Ofri Cnaani: Only handful of artifacts 20 million items that were housed in the museum survive this colossal disaster to give you a sense of perspective, they call the collection of the British Museum holds 8 million items a lobotomy of the Brazilian memory.

Ofri Cnaani: meteorite that hit areas in 17 8084 survived the fire no problem.

25
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:43.410
Ofri Cnaani: Better they've been there, go travel from space to Brazilian soils by here in rests still have the ground for several thousand years.

26
00:04:44.100 --> 00:05:03.840
Ofri Cnaani: And irregular math 5360 kilograms of iron covered by four inch layer of oxidation with numerous depressions on the surface and cylinder like holes oriented parallel to its greater legs.

27
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:13.020
Ofri Cnaani: part of its lower portion was lost during lending and left a smooth surface on one face.

28
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:28.380
Ofri Cnaani: The side I N, it also consists of nickel, cobalt, phosphorus and traces of sulfur and carbon in much smaller quantities only measured in parts, by million.

29
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.330
Ofri Cnaani: Ever since it contact with the human eye the iron has been on the move, again.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:54.900
Ofri Cnaani: The boy domingo's the motor with Hello grace cattle on the farm near the present town of monta Center when the first when he first spotted it the year was 1784.

31
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:10.200
Ofri Cnaani: Even the slow local movement of people and commerce, the news of finding of the findings spread quickly in 1785 governor do reagan's management says this.

32
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:33.240
Ofri Cnaani: arrange for it to be transported to Salvador, however, the metal right excessive weight make transportation difficult the cart it was on lost its control and the metal right phil and dry stream bed just at hundred meter away from the sport, it was originally find.

33
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:45.720
Ofri Cnaani: The method, I did not travel with the people, the people started to visit indigo the Royal Society published drawing in its periodical.

34
00:06:46.110 --> 00:07:10.260
Ofri Cnaani: In the first reproduction of the metal rock started to orbit the visual sphere, you can buy a copy in 14 pine pounds 95 the year was 18 1870 year later, it was lifted enrolled to the National Museum and stopped right by its doors.

35
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:28.800
Ofri Cnaani: First room pious passed by the armed personnel and the metal turnstiles it was resting on the national Brazilian pedestal for 130 years.

36
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.260
Ofri Cnaani: Always first to view.

37
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.930
Ofri Cnaani: The first image to take.

38
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:49.530
Ofri Cnaani: Then the fire happened no major damage stand first room behind a metal turnstiles all covered with ashes from burnt neighboring objects.

39
00:07:50.490 --> 00:08:11.220
Ofri Cnaani: images were uploaded and downloaded links were assured post were posted pictures transmitted up toward the air up toward a space and fell down to Brazilian earth, what are the means which to guess seeds.

40
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:20.550
Ofri Cnaani: After the ashes in the images vested I clicked on the link and entered the museum again.

41
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.550
Ofri Cnaani: There, there are no, no to the right or to the left.

42
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:58.530
Ofri Cnaani: I pass the two blurred faces on personnel and glided through the metal turnstiles on my way to the staircase I dragged my cursor around and above been Diego smearing glitches with depressions and cylinder shaped holes forming a God digital irregular mass of image matter.

43
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:13.440
Ofri Cnaani: Mine would hope that contemporary technology would offer its most treasure artifacts a better chance of survival than the library of Alexandria.

44
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:26.400
Ofri Cnaani: It feels almost unimaginable that so many valuable objects were simply wiped off the heirs of the face of the earth without living a digital trace.

45
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:38.250
Ofri Cnaani: The age of algorithmic reproduction when automatic backup is a default standard, too often, we need to find the right for the right to be forgotten.

46
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:54.030
Ofri Cnaani: But the economy of remembering everything is still entangled with the geography of their right to be remembered that you see this storage space was licking for a while now.

47
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:06.120
Ofri Cnaani: Over 90% of the national collection was simply lost because there was not enough water in the fire hydrant.

48
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:20.790
Ofri Cnaani: to extinguish the blaze and error, a break within the ordered world for some times now, the pressure is in the fire hydrants was too low.

49
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:31.680
Ofri Cnaani: But the high pressure of real estate industry developers didn't stop pumping bringing the system to the brink of collapse.

50
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:54.780
Ofri Cnaani: This is a dry season for fire hydrants and water pumps and local reservoir and natural water shades for some times now, but is a quarter or slowly dehydrating under official priorities for modern water dry became a condition.

51
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:05.460
Ofri Cnaani: This was an old building with old an old with building with all sorts of all lives and no.

52
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.960
Ofri Cnaani: No liquidity.

53
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:28.620
Ofri Cnaani: liquid assets, the city was busy building a brand new museum of tomorrow, it was a question of liquidity fire was the method.

54
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:41.910
Ofri Cnaani: A fragmented an eclectic digital collection survive from the ruins the images available on wiki wikimedia Commons.

55
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:57.420
Ofri Cnaani: All taken by small interest group and visitors who captured highlights from the collection that are now stored on their personal devices or cloud services or shared fire social media.

56
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:16.680
Ofri Cnaani: images, you can report are too much other data they have been slowly aggregated other images they saw location, they checked in at a personal library organized by geolocation or facial.

57
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.300
Jill Walker Rettberg: Recognition, I think.

58
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.080
Ofri Cnaani: social networks and other data.

59
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:31.230
Ofri Cnaani: They are partial anecdotal broken, but also very much connected.

60
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:44.670
Ofri Cnaani: Each file name bites contributor one name is masek shells shells that shaping the other Sofia in dinner 11.

61
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:58.410
Ofri Cnaani: The primary school age Sophia and how purple stuffed monkey with long arms are now main protagonist of the national Brazilian collection.

62
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:16.710
Ofri Cnaani: With a few dozen images named after her and new princess in what once at once, was a palace than a museum and now a site of collective witnessing of things being left acknowledged and the and acknowledged.

63
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.770
Ofri Cnaani: There is also.

64
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:49.380
Ofri Cnaani: A virtual tour product of Google art and culture, when well, one can easily visit the no longer existing museum normal boxes and cabinets the museum information is now stored through the same technology as your street.

65
00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:09.090
Ofri Cnaani: long ago collection have become a toxic warehouses for genocidal practices and histories of colonial dispositions in Eurasia where objects embodies our storage spaces for transgenerational trauma.

66
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:24.060
Ofri Cnaani: can be that parent in the fire and melted into wiki stock rooms of digital digital recollection or used by Google for data correlation.

67
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.800
Ofri Cnaani: storage is our new species of spaces.

68
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.930
Ofri Cnaani: Through via de janeiro's night sky ashes flew up to the air and fell on the ground.

69
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:56.910
Ofri Cnaani: burned and propose an ancient cockroaches trapped in backyards employee surveys and rejected papers fell quietly quietly on strips and balconies like fallen leaves.

70
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:12.660
Ofri Cnaani: index cards landed on the neighbors front porch burn particles forms another life form another life to local flights and touch down much closer to home.

71
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:21.240
Ofri Cnaani: ashes scattered and spread out the word like silent witnesses carrying by whispering wind.

72
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.600
Ofri Cnaani: The first edits on the Portuguese, we can meet Wikipedia.

73
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:56.340
Ofri Cnaani: The first edit on the Portuguese Wikipedia was made by an anonymous user at 8:40pm on the night of September 2 minutes after the reports on TV began.

74
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:03.930
Ofri Cnaani: an hour and a half later an entry dedicated to the fire itself.

75
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.510
Ofri Cnaani: was created.

76
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:19.350
Ofri Cnaani: And the following hours, the collections Wikipedia page, which was once on the update by dedicated contributors started to circulate globally.

77
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:41.280
Ofri Cnaani: Here is a stray cat pouring between two columns with peeling paint their effort of indigenous hunter a very low angled photo clearly taken by a child exposes a lick in the upper corner that was fixed with layer of brown packing to.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:20:13.350
Ofri Cnaani: Who destroyed the marks of by of the dead by consuming their own copper ality the meticulous practice of remembering to forget include drinking the liquid that came out of the cyst palaver pulverizing their bones consuming the ashes and eating the rest mixed with banana porridge.

90
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:43.890
Ofri Cnaani: The dead, have the right to be forgotten their own deeds forget them their own life erase them their belonging must be burned their metabolic system is a hell of a mnemonic device pedra stuck boxes in rooms, a colleague tells petro petro the original pieces that we were.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:22.320
Ian Hatcher: Next up on our on our bill, we have Kristen as wiley and Alfred s fox with perfect movement engineering for better every day zooming.

97
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.750
Please take it away.

98

Wiley & Fox: Okay, so everyone here can sense wonderful okay.

109
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:09.090
Wiley & Fox: So here's an overview of our extensive qualitative and quantitative research based on observing or willing zoom clientele.

110
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:19.500
Wiley & Fox: and collecting their data so after extensive review and analysis of our texts our test subjects data points we found a positive correlation between better zoom performances.

111
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:30.630
Wiley & Fox: and better workplace promotion and overall quality of life and our expert data team has assured us that this research might not be perfect.

112
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:40.320
Wiley & Fox: But it's definitely good so let's take a closer look at one of the data visualizations a deep dive, this is a rare behind the scenes look at where the magic happens.

113
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:53.460
Wiley & Fox: If you look at the upper right quadrant you can easily see that our network data points, establish a clear causal relationship between better zooming and better human we're all about the holistic human here at better movement.

114
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.100
Wiley & Fox: So the first round.

115
00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:12.480
Wiley & Fox: Based on this extensive research, we have identified three key realms of perfect movement based training, so the first run the holistic situation of the entire body, while teleconferencing the second one is the micro movements of the face, including the mandible.

116
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:19.080
Wiley & Fox: The third is the realm of hand gestures, which we know that you academics are particularly fond of.

117
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:31.350
Wiley & Fox: Okay let's get into it so we're going to need you all to turn on your cameras and Judy Would you mind turning your camera on.

121
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:58.740
Wiley & Fox: Alright So the first thing to know is that you're always performing when you're in a zoom call, especially in gallery view like this.

122
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:10.110
Wiley & Fox: People are scanning the screen and you want to make sure that your movements and expressions convey your best self so to set yourself up for success, you need to make sure your zoom.

Leonardo Flores: This conference to an almost close remember, there are panels after this so without further ado, let me introduce the awards.

357
01:20:55.170 --> 01:21:07.080
Leonardo Flores: Now that yellow wards a few things that the Community should know they're all supported through donations for the award so these did not come from membership dues.

358
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:25.050
Leonardo Flores: They every year we select member of the board that will act as awards convener, this is a person that does not have any conflict of interest in terms of being eligible for an award that given year that awards convener.

359
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:38.280
Leonardo Flores: Along with the board selects an external committee from the Community to be the jury for the award and the convener then works independently, with the jury to.

360
01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:49.620
Leonardo Flores: You know, we send out a call, but then the convenor works independently, with the jury to go through the process of selecting and awarding the yellow awards.

361

Leonardo Flores: The three elo awards that we have.

363
01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:18.330
Leonardo Flores: And board members who are eligible, the first year we were not eligible, but then became eligible for awards, as we externalize the process because of the bylaws board members cannot receive any kind of funding.

364
01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:34.170
Leonardo Flores: You know, we cannot accept funding so whenever if any board member ever wins the award that is assigned to usually a yellow fellow that helps develop projects with the board member.

365
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:38.520
Leonardo Flores: And so, these things are donated again.

440
01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:56.940
Caitlin Fisher: yeah i'll start so last year about this time at elo when we were at the way for damon lauren baker we a number of us had a discussion around the importance of recognizing.

441
01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:06.540
Caitlin Fisher: The artists and scholars and amazing people as part of the HALO community who who sometimes are not the people.

442
01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:24.000
Caitlin Fisher: Most likely to be winning other awards because they're on a crazy brilliant genius path all their own and so out of that discussion came came the idea for a maverick award you want to take it over from there Scott for a bit.

443
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:27.660
Scott Rettberg: Sure yeah and as as caitlyn said.

444
01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:43.740
Scott Rettberg: We were gathered at awake for for damon lauren Baker, who was who was somebody who kind of worked outside of the the guidelines and was very difficult person to categorize.

445
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:49.080
Scott Rettberg: And, and while we were talking at that event.

446
01:34:50.700 --> 01:35:04.440
Scott Rettberg: talent suggested that there should be a maverick award an award for for someone who took an unconventional path yeah who really sort of colored outside of the lines.

447
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:08.610
Scott Rettberg: And, of course.

448
01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:19.230
Scott Rettberg: damon is part of this prize there's a tribute to damon, which is a bottle of song jermaine damon's favorite liquor.

450
01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.770

453
01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:42.150
Scott Rettberg: we're thinking of talent Mehmet who, who I think is a maverick.

454
01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:53.070
Scott Rettberg: To which we can provide future aspirations for for everyone in the electronic literature community.

455
01:35:54.300 --> 01:36:08.400
Scott Rettberg: Those of you who know talon know that he was a skateboarder in a punk Rocker and a chef a sous chef and a chef at one of the at a great restaurant in San Francisco.

456
01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:16.110
Scott Rettberg: before he became a web designer and started a perceptive con a web design company.

457
01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:26.790
Scott Rettberg: in San Francisco and while he was he was a web designer and independent creator he created a web journal called beehive.

458
01:36:27.450 --> 01:36:37.050
Scott Rettberg: That was in the 1990s and early 2000s, one of the most important venues and adventurous venues for the publication of electronic literature.

459
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:50.010
Scott Rettberg: And then, those of you who know his work, of course, know lexi to perplex SIA, which is one of the most canonical works of electronic literature, but you also know that.

460
01:36:51.210 --> 01:37:00.180
Scott Rettberg: You know talent, who came out of a an arts background and worked a bit at cal arts and was was friends with Kathy acker and certainly.

461

Scott Rettberg: influenced by our and and developed works of in a variety of media throughout his career and continues to not trying to talk in the in the past tense about talent.

462
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:29.190
Scott Rettberg: But he he worked in film he worked in visual arts he's he's worked in electronic literature in many different varieties he's worked.

463
01:37:29.670 --> 01:37:42.960
Scott Rettberg: He worked on the Elf board to always provide the board with an alternative perspective, Robert coover I remember when he was talking about what he was trying to do, or why he.

464
01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:54.630
Scott Rettberg: got into electronic literature, to begin with and started teaching, it was he said that he always wanted to encourage writers to work against the grain of the media.

465
01:37:55.710 --> 01:37:58.110
Scott Rettberg: in which they were operating.

466
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:10.680
Scott Rettberg: And talon is someone who is always worked against the brand and always challenged the media, he did things like start the under academy college.

467
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:22.770
Scott Rettberg: An alternative university that did not a here to to the normal rules, for instance, that you, you would pay tuition or be graded.

468
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:34.650
Scott Rettberg: But instead, you would have kind of imaginary university realize where you would all create together so i'm very happy.

469
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:48.870
Scott Rettberg: to announce the first winner of the maverick award and to read the designation, which will be an award given in the future as well, by the Eo.
