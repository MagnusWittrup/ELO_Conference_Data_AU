WEBVTT

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I have not been able to see the game after the fact.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's to grow.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But I'll do it for you.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So, let's go.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This story starts with an error in six hours on Saturday night in early September 2018 flames consumed the biggest collection of Brazilian history

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
course I want to tell everything.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But the question is, when is the appropriate time to release all the information.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Only a handful of artifacts. The 20 million items that were housed in the museum survive this color so disaster.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
To give you a sense of perspective, the collection of the British Museum holds 8 million items.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
ella bottom me of the Brazilian memory

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
image of a nation.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It's lens.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Its lens and its culture, the immense encyclopedic collection included priceless archives of pre Columbian indo American cultures. The oldest human remains ever found in Brazil and audio recording of indigenous languages, may have many of them are no

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
longer spoken.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Also 5 million butterflies and other entrepreneurs, 12,000 years old fossil human remains thousands of indigenous ceramics and a fresco from Pompey

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in 1784 survived the fire, new problem.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:05:00.000
indigo travel from space to Brazilian soil of the here and rests still of the ground for several thousand years, and irregular math, 5360, kilograms of iron covered by four inch layer of oxidation with numerous depressions on the surface and cylinder

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
like holes oriented parallel to its greater legs.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Part of its lower portion was lost during lending and lift a smooth surface on one face.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Beside in. It also consists of nickel compounds, phosphorus, and traces of sulfur and carbon in much smaller quantities. only measured in parts by million.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Ever since it contact with the human eye. The iron has been on the move again.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The boy Domingo's the motor with Hello, Grace cattle on the farm near the present town of one percenter when the first when he first spotted it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The year was 1784.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Given the slow local movement of people, and commerce. The news of finding of the findings spread quickly.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:21.000
In 1785, Governor do agreements management says, arrange for it to be transported to Salvador. However, the metal right excessive weight made transportation difficult.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:42.000
The card it was on last its control, and the method right Phil, and dry stream bed just 1800 meter away from the sport It was originally find the method I did not travel with the people, the people started to visit then they go.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:54.000
There are society published drawing in its periodical, and the first reproduction of the metal rock started to orbit the visual sphere.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You can buy a copy in 14, pounds 95.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The year was 18 1817 year later, it was lifted and rolled to the National Museum and stopped right by its doors.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:30.000
First from pies passed by the personnel, and the metal turnstiles. It was resting on the national Brazilian pedestal for 130 years.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Always first to view the first image to take.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Then the fire happened, no major damage stared first through behind the metal turnstiles all covered with ashes from burnt neighboring objects images were uploaded and downloaded links were shared post were posted pictures transmitted, up to a deer up

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
toward a space and fell down to Brazilian Earth.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
What are the means, which is seeds.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:25.000
After the ashes in the images vested I clicked on the link and entered the museum again.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
They're there. They're not no no to the right or to the left.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I pass the two blurred faces on personnel and glided through the metal turnstiles on my way to the staircase. I dragged my cursor around and above been Diego smearing glitches with depressions and cylinder shaped holes, forming a god digital irregular

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
mass of image matter.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000
One would hope that contemporary technology would offer its most treasured artifacts, a better chance of survival than the Library of Alexandria.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:35.000
It feels almost unimaginable that so many valuable objects were simply white of the earth, of the face of the earth without living a digital trace, and the age of algorithmic reproduction, when automatic backup is a default standard.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Too often we need to find the right for the right to be forgotten.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But the economy of remembering everything is still entangled with the geography of the right to be remembered.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But you see, this storage space was licking for a while now.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Over 90% of the national collection was simply lost because there was not enough water in the fire hydrant to extinguish the blaze an error, a break, within the order and world.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:33.000
For some times now, the pressure is in the fire hydrants was too low, but the high pressure of real estate industry developers didn't stop pumping, bringing the system to the brink of collapse.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:53.000
This is a dry season for fire hydrants and water pumps, and local reservoir and natural water shades for some times now bodies of water are slowly dehydrating under official priorities for modern water.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Dry became a condition.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
This was an old building with old an old with building with all sorts of all lives.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And no,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
no liquidity

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
liquid assets.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
The city was busy building a brand new museum of tomorrow.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It was a question of liquidity fire was the method

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:54.000
a fragmented and eclectic digital collection survive from the ruins the images available on wiki Wikimedia Commons, all taken by small interest group and visitors who captured highlights from the collection that are now stored on their personal devices,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000
or cloud services, or shared via social media.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Their images that can report are too much other data they have been slowly aggregated other images they saw location, they checked in at a personal library, organized by geolocation or facial recognition, I think, you know, social network and other data

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
points are having the confidence.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:48.000
They are partial anecdotal broken, but also very much connected, each file name by its contributor one name is Masek shelf shells the shaping the other Sofia in the new 11.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The primary school age Sophia, and her purple stuffed monkey with long arms are now main protagonist of the national Brazilian collection, with a few dozen images named after her.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And you princess. In what once at once was a palace than a museum. And now, a site of collective witnessing of things being left acknowledged and the unacknowledged.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
There is also a virtual tour product of Google art and culture.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
When will one can easily visit the no longer existing museum.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:51.000
No more boxes and cabinets, the museum information is now stored through the same technology as your street.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Long ago, collection have become toxic warehouses for genocidal practices, and histories of colonial dispositions in Eurasia, where objects and by these are storage spaces for transgenerational trauma cabinets parent in the fire and melted into wiki stock

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:33.000
rooms of digital digital recollection, or used by Google for data correlation storage is our new species of spaces.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Through via de Janeiro's night sky ashes flew up to the air, and fell on the ground, burnt and propose an ancient cockroaches shopped in backyards employee surveys and rejected papers, fell quietly quietly on stoops and balconies, like foliage leaves

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
index cards landed on the neighbor's front porch.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Burn particles forms, another platform another life to global flights and touch down much closer to home ashes scattered and spread out the word like silent witnesses, carrying by Whispering Wind.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:43.000
The first edits on the Portuguese Wikimedia Wikipedia.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:16:08.000
The first edit on the Portuguese Wikipedia, was made by an anonymous user at 8:40pm. On the night of September 2 minutes after the reports on TV began an hour and a half later, an entry dedicated to the fire itself was created.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And the following hours, the collections Wikipedia page, which was once on the update by dedicated contributors started to circulate globally.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Here is a stray cat pouring between two columns with peeling paint their effort of indigenous Hunter, a very low angle photo clearly taken by a child exposes a link in the upper corner.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
That was fixed with layer of brown packing pick the museum loans in the winter.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:16.000
The museum loans in the summer and multiple copies of the same shirt. That was never deleted, offering a generational personal testimony. Again, institutional and amnesia.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Louise love ashes and sofa and sucker for guy ashes are the best storytellers, and surfer guy, or the best mystery form an expert of Egyptian monuments, he was brushing dust for a living.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
If you can call it a living.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:18:02.000
His work at the National Museum was like living in a giant Russian doll shaped circle Fergus and memory Chamber of all sort of things that once called life are now kept in jars and glass cases, register forms and long list catalog and exhibition shirts

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and photocopies many photocopies also slides and films tapes and floppy disk see the wrongs and memory sticks that sometimes we might have escaped this moving between rooms, and boxes, he imagined his workplace is a giant based fed with dead life forms

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and memory forms.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Each has a copy, and metabolic look like for bedroom.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:52.000
This is where life is so Life was good.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:08.000
First time now is using his toolkit to excavate his own workplace coffins and emulates staples and line levels and escape toes like memory sticks.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.000
New ashes consume the old ashes. New depth consumed all

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:41.000
the matter that recorded the evidence of violence is devour devoured by its own materiality next macro metabolism Pedre brushes and measures and put them in boxes.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:55.000
He thinks of this a normal people who live in the Yanomami but land, who destroyed the marks of by of the dead by consuming their own corporate ality.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:18.000
The meticulous practice of remembering to forget include drinking the liquid that came out of the cyst Calvary pulverizing their bones, consuming the ashes and eating the rest, mixed with banana porridge.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:43.000
The dead have the right to be forgotten their own dates, forget them. There are life, erase them. Their belonging must be burned the metabolic system is a hell of a mnemonic device pedra stack boxes in rooms, a colleague tells Petra, Petra.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:55.000
The original pieces that we were that were there are now part of our conquest through the struggle of our loved ones who are not here.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Now we have memories.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:12.000
More than what we, but we live for them and Petro Petro thinks of life of living of doing or thinking, with them with us.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Dead or Alive Ashes, ashes We all fall down.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Thank you for free for that beautiful performance.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:12.000
mode for people to react to express their appreciation.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Next up on our on our bill we have Kristen sy Lee and Alfred s Fox with perfect movement engineering for better everyday zooming.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Please take it away.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Welcome Welcome and thank you so much for joining us, or should we think your bosses for making this mandatory, we wouldn't be here without them. So, let's give them a short round of applause.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:21.000
So who are we, I'm Kristin ass Wiley and I offered as Fox and we are cc Oh is that cheap corporeal officials at good movement, Inc. We're here to present our latest invention perfect movement engineering for better every day zooming, a little bit about

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
us, we are amazing, and we are insightful and usually we're on a roll your bosses payroll.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:53.000
No seriously folks we love this this is our bread and butter with cheese and placed on a hot grill. We are the grilled cheese of this Zoo testing Brave New World, and happy to serve our Glee insights to Zoomers across the globe.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
We do this for upwards of $2,000 thousand dollars now. That's a lot.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:16.000
That's a day, we're generously donating our time to yellow. We're here to help you maximize your performances to level up or Zuma. So, before we begin, we need to get a little disclaimer, out of the way.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:25.000
So take a moment to read it, there's nothing unusual here just your typical terms and conditions.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:35.000
It continues So take a moment to scan it make sure everything is in order.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Okay, here's the last bit go ahead and finish reading.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Okay, great. So if you find our terms and conditions to be disagreeable. We invite you to leave the zoom call now hit the road jack, and if you stay, you are legally bound to our terms and conditions as being president this presentation confirms your

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
consent.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Okay, so everyone here can sense. Wonderful. Okay.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000
So, here's an overview of our extensive qualitative and quantitative research based on observing our willing zoom clientele, and collecting their data.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:28.000
so after extensive review and analysis of our texts or test subjects data points. We found a positive correlation between better zoom performances and better workplace promotions and overall quality of life, and our expert data team has assured us that

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:41.000
this research might not be perfect, but it's definitely good. So let's take a closer look at one of the data visualization, a deep dive. This is a rare behind the scenes look at where the magic happens.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:55.000
If you look at the upper right quadrant, you can easily see that our network data points establish a clear causal relationship between better zooming and better shoe money, we're all about the holistic human here at better movement ink.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:07.000
So, the first round, based on this extensive research we have identified three key realms of perfect movement based training. So, the first round the holistic situation of the entire body while teleconferencing.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
The second one is the micro movements of the face, including the man.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000
The third is the realm of hand gestures which we know that you academics are particularly fond of.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Okay, let's get into it. So we're going to need you are to turn on your cameras, Judy, would you mind, turning your camera on, Mark, would you mind also your camera because you might turn that on a en camera on please, a retro yeah please can you turn

00:26:40.000 --> 00:27:00.000
your camera on Marjorie, we'd like to ask you to turn your camera on please okay anybody else, it doesn't have their camera on go ahead and flip that switch and turn that camera right ahead and turn that camera.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:13.000
People are scanning the screen and you want to make sure that your movements and expressions convey your best self. So, to set yourself up for success you need to make sure your zoom platform is on point.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:31.000
So, we'd like to invite you to click the arrow next to your video icon. Click Choose video filter, and then you'll see a range of options. For instance, if you are attending a Theodora hustle, it might make sense to use this stage filter.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Most workplace contacts, you're probably want to keep it more professional so make sure to choose a filter that portrays you in your best light. We're particularly excited about the beta studio affects the zoom just rolled out, you'll find these by accessing

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
the blue link and the bottom right corner of the video filters pop up box.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:04.000
We've got browse, we've got lip color, just to make sure that if you're using these filters that you make sure that they are always on point.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Now, what you've all been waiting for. We're going to demo three perfect movements. perfect movement, number one, the attempt, nod.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So you're nodding thoughtfully. You're conveying attentiveness.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:36.000
And now let's break down these specific features that continuous nodding at an even tempo, not too fast, not

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
just.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:55.000
You're gonna want to slay me raise your eyebrows. Not too much you don't want to seem surprised, but wow, that was a really good idea and you really taken it in widened those eyes, but not too much, lean in, but not too far into slightly just to show.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Meaning just slightly just to show. I'm really contemplating that while you're doing this, be careful to manage the micro movements and your eyebrows and your cheekbones, people will notice what's happening across your entire face.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:19.000
So once you've mastered the basics of this gesture, we have some optional advanced add on features for instance, chin on hand, you might lean forward.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Hmm, and then keep nodding because how you're really thinking, or the hush your cell phone up Jessica to show you're really listening.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:48.000
So perfect movement. Number two, the empathetic furrow, you're concerned, but you're showing empathy. Now let's break down the specific features. So, the furrowed brow.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:30:08.000
The furrowed eyebrows soft eyes but not too soft. You don't want to look like you're asleep. Slightly flared nostrils to really show how much you're empathizing and a frown, an empathetic from though not a clown from

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:22.000
perfect movement number three, the million miles smile. You're leaving the meeting, you're giving your best outros smile and wave. You're conveying genuine warmth and leaving them all with a winning million mile smile.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Now let's break down the specific features.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
The term.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Make sure to choose good so that big movie star smile, make sure to scrunch your eyes and lift your cheekbones to convey genuine warm.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:51.000
The speed and rhythm of the wave, not too fast, not slow just right just right.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:02.000
So the hands also need to be in a correct distance from the camera so not too far. Oh, hello, or not too close, just right.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000
So now freeze Once you've done this for a couple of moments you've gotten in your smile on your way you've made sure everyone has seen it while you're trying to find the button to leave the call.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:21.000
You're going to pause your wave and just freeze, while you find the clothes buttons you make sure to leave them with the best image.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Okay, great. So now you're all going to get together and breakout rooms to practice in small groups you'll coach and support each other, to maximize your effective performance for each perfect movement.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Once you've helped each other level up, and you've all reached optimal levels for one of the three movements, you will take a screenshot.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:58.000
So, you should, in effect, have three screenshots within five minutes, one document in each of the three perfect movements, you're going to want to designate one person within your small group to take each screenshot and upload it to a folder that we

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000

You three are you ready.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.000
I think if everyone could turn their video off for this one I think this one may consume a bit of bandwidth and we'll run better that way.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I'm ready. Are you ready.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Want to say about yourself.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:35.000
This is the original Rhinestone Cowboy.

Play show known throughout the world.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
I was sitting on my bedside.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Just as lonesome as could be.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
And I said to my grandmother.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.000
I said suffer Latif, give me something to make me brave.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And it may seem.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Unbelievable.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
But my mother replied.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
She said,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Make

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
you

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:27.000
an outfit.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
was sitting on my bed side.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
It says lonesome as can be.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
And I said to the stranger.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Give me something to make me calm.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And it may seem unbelievable.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
But the anonymous reply

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:17.000
was make you an outfit.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.000
I was lying in my bed.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
As I could be

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:43.000
my Dad, Give me something to make me free.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
And it may seem unbelievable.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:57.000
My dad gave me a number of cows.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:27.000
TBODER.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:50:00.000
TBODER.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.000

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Hi.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Miss.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Miss.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Oh wait.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Well, I don't really

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:38.000
cold my

00:54:38.000 --> 00:55:02.000
smile.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:13.000
put you down.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:22.000
riding the train, taking

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
So many

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:49.000
sexy is so.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
so many, so many no compromise.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:24.000
10.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:17.000
TEODER.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:34.000
This is amazing. How many hours a day do you think you work on this

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.000
did many many many

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:51.000
yes can change the design in making some different plans coming on yet.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:05.000
See,

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:18.000
go see the beautiful design game we can work.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:31.000
And they just

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
walking these streets so love

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.000
singing the same song.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Later,

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000
We have holster, a hollow phone.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Because the saddle is inside us, and we are inside it.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
How.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Go.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
That hollers called a Turkish seat.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Because home is a fortress for its masters repose

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:40.000
his innermost embrace agers illuminate the cover song.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Because when he dances up a blue streak. I can't tell them from the source.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
in the theater of the discovers.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We forgot that our windows are in bracers still

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:47.000
because of man's home is his cast drum is cut.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:57.000
We extend our arm through the double flick.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So that the other side becomes

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
the other side,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:19.000
an eruption of rhinestones dazzling our walls.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Because in embrace your

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000
is a whole that whole

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
because an abrasion

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
is a whole.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That whole.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:13.000
nudie suit is a way of covering while being uncovered

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:35.000
to invert the monument. We shock it show you humpbacks becomes concave a cavity and a crypt each step along the Portage to Chicago, these diligent workers, a vengeance burst with an eagerness a really lovely

01:03:35.000 --> 01:04:05.000
memory another exchange. one of the Ranger before.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Meet Empire has whiter teeth than shoulders, In the city of inverted architecture.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:24.000
that rotates the rack to transfer power easily.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So that even the angels are complicit in confabulated history.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:44.000
We invoke this operation for a tender inversion

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
of our bodies.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000
We dilate the Penumbra of our embrace.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:04.000
We domesticate a date avoid of our embrace your

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000
to me make a bottom of a tower top bottom.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000
We plumb the society need

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
have the highest heights.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:30.000
That's that's Pender.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I have to get to the other side of the animal.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Under embrace bracers in danger me.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
her out on a horse.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:19.000
In our intractable tract, with a breath that lands.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:41.000
too late now. Not to me, tenderness.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Not to regret the breath of language, the memory

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:06.000
includes myself fortify, my home. body breath. From the

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:29.000
other side.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Under embrace collapse.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:51.000
The windows duration.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It's really not real.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Each piece of the corpus passed over our wall reconfigures.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
We agree to share

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:17.000
into a sentence, whose risks are not palpable nos

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:28.000
TENDDR.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I have to get to the other side.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I had them all.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
II

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:21.000
MBRASURE charge

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
in the fort's edition.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
The aperture faces itself.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Because the fort is inside us.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And we are inside it,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:03.000
the fort's disappearance, became a fort by the same name.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Because it records it replicates itself without effort, or and

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
embrace your

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:35.000
divides us in a weaponized whole.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Because the fort knows how to mark a body.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It's elbows bound in a elbows bound in a sailor's handshake handshake.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Because violence is

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:40.000
because violence is the tenders embrace the tenders embrace.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
sitting on my bed said just as lonesome as can be.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And as said to the Lord, give me something to make me happy.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And it may seem believable but

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
may.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And now,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Tamar Tamar.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:49.000
totally do.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Thank you.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Thank you. Thank you. Hello.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Thank you, Doug.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
get so theatrical hot what happened,

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
green to yellow.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Beautiful performance guys beautiful. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Thank you so much for that magical piece, and thank you to all the artists on the program of the last four days and, as well as the artists who contributed work to the video gallery and to the other conference galleries.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Some of most of the live performances from the past four days have been archived on films, but some are ephemeral and will disappear soon so if you have this something you would like to see a lot of beautiful things that happened, check those out soon.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And I think now it's time for award so let me pass my hosting baton on.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Thank you so much.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Folks, this was a really special set of performances. They have all been strong, but we.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Today we got to see zoom dress down and built back up again it's amazing.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So thank you all right, folks.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:50.000
We know that the next panel begins at four. We have a brief award ceremony. And thanks to the organizers because this is the the the closing event please bear with us as we bring this this conference to an almost close remember there are panels after

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:08.000
this. So, without further ado, let me introduce the awards. Now that yellow awards a few things that the community should know, they're all supported through donations for the award so these did not come from membership dues.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:24.000
They every year we select member of the board that will act as awards convener. This is a person that does not have any conflict of interest in terms of being eligible for an award that given year.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:44.000
That awards convener along with the board selects an external committee from the community to be the jury for the award, and the convener then works independently with the jury to, you know, we send out a call, but then the convener works independently

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:51.000
with a jury to go through the process of selecting and awarding the yellow awards.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:22:16.000
The three yellow awards that we have come with $1,000 Prize, as well as a little plaque and board members who are eligible, the first year we were not eligible but then became eligible for awards as we externalize the process, because of the bylaws, board

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
members cannot receive any kind of funding.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:37.000
You know, we cannot accept funding. So, whenever, if any board member ever wins the award. That is assigned to usually a fellow fellow, that helps develop projects with the board member.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And so these things are donated again.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Without further ado, honor that I will introduce on an offer, who served as our awards convener and who's going to introduce the jury. And, and the awardees, so I'm all yours.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Thank you, Leo let me share my screen so I can show you what it's going on with, with the awards this year.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I hope you can see my screen.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
And,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:28.000
yeah, and here's the presentation so um yeah So indeed, I have a great pleasure and an honor to serve as, as the EO 2021, however it's convenient convener.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And of course we have three categories, and I guess most of you are already familiar with, with the categories or other cooler words for a work of electronic richer the mkH inhales a word for for criticism of electronic literature and the merger easy

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
lucid dream Career Achievement Award.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And, and the new category is coming, and it's going to be announced in roughly 10 minutes.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So I had a great pleasure to to to work with wonderful remembers. And this year jury for the Robert Scoble awards, where Jason lewis i mean i'm happy and current and on the team.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And I would like to also emphasize the fact that that the number of nominated works. This year was on significant rise from last year last year was 28 works nominated this year.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:50.000
It was 49 nominated artworks so it speaks volumes about how our field is expanding. And here are shortlisted artworks.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This is the first of the shortlisted ones and see already probably know that it is Diego Bonita big data, and other artwork that will surely set, and this year I asked for, for show the set, and one winner so you'll probably know that another shortlisted

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:34.000
artwork is Jason Nelson's, the wonders of last trajectories. And here you can see the jury's justifications, and we're a bit of time constraints. So I'm going to read all the justifications, you will be able to read it for us have probably in Mark Marino's

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:41.000
announcements that usually comes after the ceremony.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000
places and people, and I'm not sure actually if I pronounced the name Shang tune Tim and Maria raw Oliva.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:29.000

And here is the justification of the jury.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And I think it's also interesting that this artwork is kind of falls into the category that's not often discussed just webcomics. This is interesting in itself.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Another category is the M catching has a word for criticism of electronic literature and Judy this year.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:42.000
And here is what Vereen have emphasized about the book.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:53.000

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And finally the Marjorie see Lusa bring Career Achievement Awards.

capable injure.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And also, I guess you'll agree that it's well deserved.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:49.000
And so now I would like to ask the winners, if they are with us to say a few words.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I think we'll start with the winner of the robots Cooper awards. I'm wondering if if life is here with us.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Probably not. I cannot really see

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
all the

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:20.000
functions here so I don't see who is saying yes or no. For example, so as you realize that it's not here with us and Jessica.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Are you here

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:33.000
we go. I've been here, Jessica in the audience, Kate, are you here with us today.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yeah. Yes, I'm here Can you hear me. Yes. Congratulations.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Thank you. It's really fantastic. I'm, I'm very surprised really a great honor. I went to my first yellow conference in 2002.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Yeah, 2002 in Los Angeles, which is where I met Caitlyn Fisher and Dana Larsen and Dini and various other people so that is a lifetime really isn't it so thank you.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Thank you so much for being being with us and and re emphasize your long standing cooperation and all the contribution that that you brought in into activity of the organization, and it, this, this.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I'm verdict also will be delivered by the one and only Mark Marino who's gonna send out the announcement.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And one more, one yellow or tomorrow. this year. And this is a new category that we wants to introduce, and the category is the maverick.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And do you all probably know who's gonna be over there with the maverick, and soon, and I'm going to pass to Scott red bird and Caitlin Fisher who tell a bit more about the origins of the category and about behind the scenes, so to speak, I'm Caitlin.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Sure, are you there Scott. I'm here. Okay, it's a bit anticlimactic now screen sharing for a minute or, or not.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Maybe you could start anyway.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yeah, so go ahead.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Yeah, I'll start. Um, so last year about this time at ELO when we were at the week for David Lauren Baker, we a number of us had a discussion around the importance of recognizing the artists and scholars and amazing people.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:15.000
As part of the halo community who, who sometimes are not the people, most likely to be winning the other awards because they're on a crazy brilliant genius path all their own.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And so out of that discussion came came the idea for a maverick award. You want to take it over. From there, Scott for bit. Sure, yeah and as as Caitlyn said we were gathered at awake for, for, Damon, learn Baker, who was who was somebody who kind of

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:52.000
worked outside of the the guidelines and was very difficult person to categorize and and while we were talking at that event.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Talent suggested that there should be a maverick award, an award for for someone who took an unconventional path. Yeah, who really sort of colored outside of the lines.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And, of course, Damon is part of this prize there's a tribute to Damon, which is a bottle of Sondra man Damon's favorite liquor.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And the prize will be $500 in a bottle of the center man.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:37.000
But as we as we make this award for the first time.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:45.000
We're thinking of talent, who I think is a maverick

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:55.000
to which we can provide future aspirations for for everyone in the electronic literature community.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Those of you who know talent, know that he was a skateboarder in a punk rocker, and a chef, a sous chef and a chef at one of the, a great restaurant in San Francisco, before he became a web designer and started a perceptive con a web design company in

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:28.000
San Francisco, and while he was, he was a web designer and independent creator, he created a web journal called beehive.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
That was in the 1990s and early 2000s.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:41.000
One of the most important venues and adventurous venues for the publication of electronic literature. And then those of you who know his work.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Of course know Lexi to perplex sia, which is one of the most canonical works of electronic literature, but you also know that, you know, talent who came out of a, an arts background I worked a bit at Cal Arts and was was friends with Kathy actor and certainly

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:09.000
influenced by and developed works in a variety of media.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Throughout his career and continues to not trying to talk in the in the past tense about talent.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
But he he worked in film.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:39.000
He worked in Visual Arts he's, he's worked in electronic literature in many different varieties. He's worked. He worked on the LL board to always provide the yellow board with an alternative perspective, Robert Coover.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I remember when he was talking about what he was trying to do or why he got into electronic literature to begin with and started teaching it was he said that he always wanted to encourage writers to work against the grain of the media, in which they were

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:13.000
operating and talent is someone who has always worked against the brain, and always challenged the media, he did things like start the under Academy college.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
An alternative University.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:32.000
That did not a here, to, to the normal rules for instance that you, you would pay tuition or be graded, but instead you would have kind of imaginary University realized, where you would all create together.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:48.000
So I'm very happy to announce the first winner of the maverick award, and to read the designation, which will be an award given in the future as well.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
by the yellow.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And of course it'll be donation supported I encourage you all to donate, I will after this event.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000
So, the maverick is to be awarded annually to an independent spirit.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:15.000
A writer artist researcher programmer designer performer, or hybrid creator who does not adhere to a conventional path.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
But creates their own.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And in so doing, makes a singular contribution to the field of electronic literature.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And the winner, of course, is talent.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Well, I just wanted to just on behalf of my brother.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
He lives at Maverick life.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And he did and he does, and he did from when he was a little kid.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000
You can imagine growing up in a house with him.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Being a little kid, and

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:26.000
him and a neighbor starting a film company at like 14 years old, and they started a theater in the neighbor's house concession stand.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Amazing movies, you know, stop action films all this stuff.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And it just continued on from there. And for for me to be able to accept this on his behalf.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000
You have to understand that he was an inspiration for me to go into art education as well.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I know he would have loved to have been here to accept it.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Sorry.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
It won't just serve as an encouragement warm.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:28.000
But it will serve as an acknowledgement of years of hard work, dedication of perseverance, that all that to finally be recognized for it.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So I want to thank ELO for honoring him in this way.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And thank you for understanding and encouraging his Maverick way.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So thank you.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:58.000
All right, love, love you The Mamet's, love you, love you, Dennis and love talent.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:11.000
So, talent will be watching this this video momentarily. And we hope that he has many years of creation, ahead of him.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:29.000
But I think this moment of recognizing that electronic literature isn't just about those of us who, who choose a conventional path, but those of us who, who do things that no one would expect.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:44.000
That's how our field came about and telling them what I think is the person who personifies that most. So thank you to the yellow for deciding to give this award.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And thank you to talent and also our hearts go out right now to the moment family.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Talent is is going to is going through some difficult times right now, but he's, he's going to survive and his life's work is treasured and valued by all of us.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:27.000
So thanks so much. Thank you so much and I must add that talent is a great colleague, amazing colleague, I was lucky enough to teach at Winona State University in creative visual media with Devin Heckman and time management and our conversation we're

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:46.000
just fascinating so sending all my love and healing energies to tell them to both methods, actually.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Um, so I think we don't have much time left and I was thoroughly stressed through this ceremony for many reasons but I would like to add some gratitude and huge things.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:25.000
First of all, I'm immensely grateful to all the jury's members whose work I so much, appreciate, and whose contributions in also in terms of comments and opinions they wanted to share with us about the process, and will still end the discussion that I

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:44.000
hope will contribute to how this process will what it will look like in the nearest future and special things go to Holly Slocum for her enthusiasts skills and willingness to help and I want you all to show your applause and appreciation to Holly who

01:44:44.000 --> 01:45:05.000

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.000
While you deal with, with the conference itself and all the hassles that entails.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:19.000
So, to one of my best friends and favorite collaborators with whom I will collaborate on many projects in the future.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:37.000

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Am I on, I guess, man.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:50:04.000
It's been amazing working together with all the people behind the scenes and you know it's too late to mention everybody, but the on the website and. And also, I want to say, you know, without you, Scott, I wouldn't dare to do this.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:14.000
And it would have been some things would have been easier because yeah thanks just kept growing, but that's part of the phone.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:30.000
And then I will also say you know i to everybody who participated that listening in on, on, I've been at about a third of the panels or something. It's just been amazing to see how people grasp the ideas the discussions.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Of course soon fatigue is a real thing but but but there's just been lively discussions, people have kept the time and and and you know really been contributing.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
So I think that, you know, we all go go from this.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:58.000
With more stuff for our research more to work on, but also the, the amazing art performances and these patients is just, it's been an amazing week.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:08.000
So thanks a lot to everybody.

You're still a panel left.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:16.000
There's still a panel left. Yeah. And, yeah, don't forget, you know there's a panel like in four minutes.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Yeah. And I'd also say that, for me, the fact that all of these recordings of all these panels are up on Vimeo.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:34.000
The yellow doesn't end here. I'm going to be watching so many panels that that I missed.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:42.000
