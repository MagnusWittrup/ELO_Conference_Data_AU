77
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.570
Agust?n Berti: So thank you Leo for setting up, yes, the theoretical framework.

78
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:15.090
Agust?n Berti: We had this plan to switch back and forth from Spanish to English, so I had the burden of speaking in English, so I apologize in advance for not for my pitch in English.

79
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:28.890
Agust?n Berti: I have written short AC which is available on the platform, if anyone is interested and my English is much better in writing than in speaking so.

80
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:37.650
Agust?n Berti: Taking on from from leo's abroad and losers idea I will present some.

81
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:47.970
Agust?n Berti: intuitions that we've been currently discussing between the four of us in several events and courses other.

82
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.600
Agust?n Berti: scholarly and not so scholarly.

83
00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:01.650
Agust?n Berti: places we share, and so, since that the problem was the the colonial.

84
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:08.760
Agust?n Berti: theory applied or used to deal with it.

85
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.920
Agust?n Berti: I just wanted to review the idea.

86
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:21.480
Agust?n Berti: Of lottie phone yo, which is a very common trope in Latin American literature.

87
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:32.220
Agust?n Berti: With regards to the platforms, so I will just try to make a provocative an analogy, of course, is just a sort of.

88
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:49.260
Agust?n Berti: game in order to think the possibilities and try to think platforms as a form of land on, so the main dimensions, called the country on the platform taking home from rain Williams, the country and the city.

89
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.080
Agust?n Berti: or the issue of nano form.

90
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.900
Agust?n Berti: And the Norway these not sharing the screen Okay, yes.

91
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:07.470
Agust?n Berti: So some basic assumptions on what digital literacy digital culture is before getting into it.

92
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:25.560
Agust?n Berti: First of all, what the there are some assumptions, I would like to challenge, but first of all that digital literacy digital culture is not a process of D materialisation and we could do, but rather process of miniaturization and acceleration.

93
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.060
Agust?n Berti: With.

94
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:41.190
Agust?n Berti: That miniaturization which takes place on servers and on networks makes way for large economies of scale which are based on data collection and data processing.

95
00:16:42.690 --> 00:17:01.740
Agust?n Berti: These data collection is allowed by this infrastructure that I mentioned before, which operates according to standards, standards are themselves a problem and epistemological problem worthy of attention and I I come basically.

96
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.630
Agust?n Berti: From philosophy of technology and it is a an important.

97
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.490
Agust?n Berti: discussion going on on standards in philosophy of them.

98
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:24.090
Agust?n Berti: And so, digital reproducibility of cultural forms which operates in this form of standards of digital standards.

99
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:36.270
Agust?n Berti: Reduced reduces cultural forms to unspecific forms of digital content, I will not get too much into these because I discussed it elsewhere and but i'm just.

100
00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:46.530
Agust?n Berti: Thinking a critiquing here, the idea of convergence quarter by Jenkins, which is very popular so.

101
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:59.250
Agust?n Berti: What has happened is that convergence content covered called convergence culture has expanded the ideas of culture based on authorship and copyright and.

102
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:17.910
Agust?n Berti: That from capitalism is the current stage of cultural industry that is my my strong hypotheses for this presentation that depends on the corporate control of huge collections of digitized and digital content which a create these large economies of scale.

103
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.250
Agust?n Berti: So.

104
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:31.110
Agust?n Berti: In my brief essay called cleanness natural history where he critics, the idea is one of the first.

105
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:42.390
Agust?n Berti: theoretical approaches to a critique of massive landowning or let the phone yeah which has characterized the history of Latin America until now.

106
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:55.380
Agust?n Berti: It has been associated associated to extract activism, and so I think it's a resumes it summarizes many of the conflicts that underlie Latin American literature.

107
00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:07.410
Agust?n Berti: and which are frequent one one studies lesson American literature, but such conflicts world so present in English literature as Reynolds will rain on Williams.

108
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:24.300
Agust?n Berti: Book the country in the city, which I quoted earlier suggests, so my thesis is now that, since a lot the phone yet still exists, of course, but also now we are migrating to a.

109
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.690
Agust?n Berti: New landscape, where there isn't another form of London, which is none of them.

110
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:41.250
Agust?n Berti: So what are the roots of nano phone yeah I will I would characterize use nano phone yet to characterize major cultural platforms.

111
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:53.820
Agust?n Berti: The roots of nano form, there are the illusion of the materialisation, which is actually, as I said, form of miniaturization the heels of democracy democratization and freedom of speech that.

112
00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:08.430
Agust?n Berti: end up in just being freedom of input, as anyone who uses Facebook may very well know the emergence of a new form of access activism, which is known as extra activism.

113
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.350
Agust?n Berti: They.

114
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:24.210
Agust?n Berti: Alleged universal accessibility ending up in a form of stratified accesses which a scholarly journals exemplify very clearly, but also all the forms of a.

115
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:40.560
Agust?n Berti: paywall and restricted service access and the siren chance of optimization or rationalization which started in the late 70s, but with the neoliberal economy model have a.

116
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.130
Agust?n Berti: taking over the.

117
00:20:45.810 --> 00:21:04.890
Agust?n Berti: economical rationality in that in precarious label or lean platforms sleazy correct there isn't them, which are fueled by biker blog and collaborator on cars as the newer or homes, as in airbnb or other forms of surplus extraction.

118
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:16.470
Agust?n Berti: So that is a I think a continuation of the concentration of land or property if your hands.

119
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.760
Agust?n Berti: And that concentration is characterized by form of a me.

120
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:38.430
Agust?n Berti: by the presence of a this a fragile entities migrant entities either be them workers or a works in either form.

121
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:55.770
Agust?n Berti: Extra activism also operates in the real world, and it has effects on the real world, I heard some keynotes very, especially the keynote on read books which took this impact into consideration.

122
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:06.180
Agust?n Berti: And a the the extension of digital technologies is also based on their primary ization of the global South.

123
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:24.270
Agust?n Berti: Which Indian dance ends up being just Google Western colonialism in a new form, so these modernization promises end up being just what we always knew, you know we will cook whoever wants to cope with it us Elon musk's.

124
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.580
Agust?n Berti: bluntly puts it.

125
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:42.000
Agust?n Berti: So my question and I will be finishing with this is is there, possible to develop a geopolitics of illiterate, are taking on from jameson's idea, the idea.

126
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:59.490
Agust?n Berti: And instead geopolitical aesthetics, so my claim is that if there is to be a geopolitics of electronic literature, the struggles will be about national and regional digital infrastructures and the local regulations over.

127
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:20.430
Agust?n Berti: or trying to cope with a globalized attention economy, the problem is about how much can we tolerate the expansion of cultural nano form yeah and I think it has a lot to say here, because a snail for it it's the place where things go beyond what they are programmed to be or mighty.

128
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.470
Agust?n Berti: So, with an iron Blair who will follow after me we've.

129
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.870
Agust?n Berti: tried to identify the specifics of.

130
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.930
Agust?n Berti: This kind of.

131
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:54.540
Agust?n Berti: breaking the rules of the practice or opening the blood black box in the context of electronic literature and other forms of digital culture and we develop the the concept of an address, which means making impossible, the algorithmic appropriation of.

132
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.850
Agust?n Berti: works or content or well they're.

133
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:11.940
Agust?n Berti: Trying to prevent works from becoming mirror content, so that this has been identified as a form of resistance, but also a form of creativity, I think, and I will.

134
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.180
Agust?n Berti: get a little bit deeper on that.

135
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:22.650
Agust?n Berti: And to close my presentation, I would say that my intuition, is that a literature.

136
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:31.710
Agust?n Berti: Is the fertile ground to the for developing other forms of digital culture different sorry.

137
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:46.710
Agust?n Berti: I wanted to avoid going over my time too much, so I was saying, my intuition, is that illiterate, there is a fertile ground for developing forms of digital culture or other than platform capitalism.

138
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:56.400
Agust?n Berti: towards a fairer redistribution of digital space that is a politic and and I started for the nano comments as opposed to learn from you.

139
00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:04.230

Claudia Kozak: I will share my screen.

200
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.490
here.

Claudia Kozak: Okay, thank you very much.

207
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.350
Claudia Kozak: I will focus on Latin American.

208
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:17.190
Claudia Kozak: elite that particularly engaging constructing dealing king and disruptively occupying contemporary platform culture.

209
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:28.680
Claudia Kozak: And this is a short presentation, so I will not develop my theoretical framework, I would i've been working with a theoretical framework.

210
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:46.650
Claudia Kozak: That is part of the colonial thinking in the way Walter mineola elaborated or even the epistemology is of the south point by the term was coined by by the Internet is also Santos.

211
00:36:47.040 --> 00:37:04.710
Claudia Kozak: These authors do not necessarily refer to the colonization regarding digital culture, but they certainly give us a point of departure in terms of what the noise notion of decolonization means in order to not vandalize it or flatten.

212
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:17.490
Claudia Kozak: i've already written publish and an essay at abr earlier this year and I will give you the link, if you want to read it.

213
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:38.370
Claudia Kozak: But shortly, I hope, okay here you have only a few quotes from them all from mineola and an evil econo who media mineola quoting also just in order to to.

214
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.460
Claudia Kozak: intro that this.

215
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:50.670
Claudia Kozak: idea of the linking, which is the main idea, I will try to post now.

216
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:59.190
Claudia Kozak: The idea that we need Okay, he begins with an eye on it, but anyway.

217
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:06.420
Claudia Kozak: The idea that we need the need for political and epistemic the linking comes here to the fore.

218
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:29.100
Claudia Kozak: As do depend on icing knowledge and the colonial knowledge is as necessary steps to imagining and building democratic and non imperial colonial society so know the idea that the the colonial or the colonial shift is a project of the linking in Spanish, the linking.

219
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:39.930
Claudia Kozak: In a way, is associate associated with this idea of key candidate this brand they're serving policy owners.

220
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:56.640
Claudia Kozak: There originally the mother mother in law colonial era and the Armenian definitive are controllable naposki to either legacy to leave this leverages but, given that this panel is like a mix in English and Spanish.

221
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:06.480
Claudia Kozak: The stress, I put here on mineola choice of this particular verb in English is not without implications to dealing.

222
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:28.740
Claudia Kozak: In English means to break that connection between something and something ends, but the noun and activate delinquent also exists to refer to a person or maybe to qualify behavior tending to commit crime particular minor crime.

223
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:41.370
Claudia Kozak: Is Spanish The thing is different because Spanish speaking people thought kind of have to associate this English word.

224
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:55.590
Claudia Kozak: To it's a disruption like something that is out of law, meaning since billing here in Spanish only and only means to break the law.

225
00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:09.660
Claudia Kozak: So it's like we can we hear that word in English, but with the codified this word in Spanish, changing the meaning, then.

226
00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:25.890
Claudia Kozak: The main meaning the word pass and, as you may know, Walter mineola is an Argentinian who has been teaching in the United States since the ids, so I think this kind of a.

227
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.780
Claudia Kozak: I think.

228
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:36.630
Claudia Kozak: He he's also very aware of these nuances of the of the world okay.

229
00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:51.150
Claudia Kozak: As you see, my approach, a today's kind of a cultural and linguistic one according to the title of my my presentation that suggests that, besides the linking.

230
00:40:51.870 --> 00:41:01.920
Claudia Kozak: We can also bond the colonial thinking to a more activist way of conceiving that the colonial sheet in terms of occupying colonial spaces.

231
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:17.250
Claudia Kozak: The idea of occupy the streets of course is behind this, however, the similarities between occupying the streets and occupying digital platforms have it's limited.

232
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.240
Claudia Kozak: There are several similarities, but there are differences, I cannot.

233
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:37.800
Claudia Kozak: Go farther but the potential empowerment of the people and emancipator is social transformations that in certain circumstances make derived from occupying streets.

234
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:47.730
Claudia Kozak: are usually more tangible that the MC buddy potentials that might derived from just occupying digital.

235
00:41:48.540 --> 00:42:03.990
Claudia Kozak: platforms and I wanted to stress just occupying I have a Chilean example, but I don't have time to everything Chilean it's something about this, but I don't have time to to develop it anyway.

236
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.010
Claudia Kozak: My main argument.

237
00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:23.640
Claudia Kozak: deal is that my is that a waste of occupying digital culture and it's valid forms a could be.

238
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:32.400
Claudia Kozak: disruptive but that would not mean just to occupy the platforms, as they are.

239
00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.790
Claudia Kozak: occupied the platforms means to be.

240
00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:57.120
Claudia Kozak: There are, I know, but also to the link to deviate and to open up ways of seeing and deal with what digital platforms culture means, while we are there and, ultimately, it means to invent new platforms and their structural base as well.

241
00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:12.210
Claudia Kozak: So in regards to Latin American League, I think we can enumerate listed some, but also the differentiate some possible paths.

242
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:19.260
Claudia Kozak: One of them would be a complete change regarding means of production.

243
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:32.130
Claudia Kozak: But is there any chance for live to do something else in the meantime before if ever that change occur occurs.

244
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:51.660
Claudia Kozak: The other way would be to explore experimental political digital literature digital languages activism and sort of interventions of the on the digital machine as a whole or in part.

245
00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:09.690
Claudia Kozak: A third level could be exploring the colonial determines involved in experimental is an even interventions in mainstream platform culture related to contemporary social media.

246
00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:30.420
Claudia Kozak: And the fourth level could be digital activism in indigenous indigenous languages, I will only refer to the second and the third level of efficacy of these roads, I i'm thinking of levels because.

247
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:57.390
Claudia Kozak: Maybe the extreme efficacy would come if you if we could change infrastructures, as our team told us, but in the meantime, I will refer for example to this second level of efficacy, which is close to the first one.

248
00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.850
Claudia Kozak: and

249
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:11.730
Claudia Kozak: I think we can find many, many examples in a Latin American elite of experimental political digital literature.

250
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:27.210
Claudia Kozak: Some digital languages activism programming languages activism included and elite that intervenes the digital machine as a whole or in part.

251
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:44.610
Claudia Kozak: i'm thinking here in it works that not only the family lies digital environments and they afforded says, but the base on digital languages themselves and even interrupt the digital apparatus as a whole.

252
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:58.440
Claudia Kozak: It when your DSL is well now works under the tag of algorithm politics factors that are the seven or email or even generally brasileira America north or Amazon.

253
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:13.440
Claudia Kozak: are perhaps the more vivid examples, but also other words by the Sally which clear intervene in the realm of the means of production for into instance certain autonomous digital infrastructures, like a horse.

254
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:34.470
Claudia Kozak: He defines a horse as an open source mobile web platform platform for the collaborative creation of maps and Community memories, the same for environments with low or no connectivity a here you have an image of Amazon.

255
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:52.620
Claudia Kozak: I think this work can give us some hints for these options within the second level of disruptive efficacy, again, we have here at it with many one says Amazon for the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.

256
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:57.690
Claudia Kozak: Which is being clear cut at the rate of three football fields per minute.

257
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:11.640
Claudia Kozak: but also for one of the most symbolic global corporations of these 21st century which bitterly hollering its name began as a company devoted to the global online selling of printed books.

258
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:29.280
Claudia Kozak: Using paper, of course, except product of the same deforestation, a corporation that has diversified nowadays in huge proposal proportions into a universal production of digital audio visual content.

259
00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:48.000
Claudia Kozak: Every day, I agree with life and so on, in other words, in other words, to make visible the link in between all the components of the work called as a vector i'm quoting a vector that transforms your desires into that per.

260
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:51.150
Claudia Kozak: capita Lawson and.

261
00:47:52.170 --> 00:48:09.540
Claudia Kozak: Even fastest were men machines Amazon, they would they defend it works work makes visible the code leading us to do something else that clicking to execute it be just a small step in between.

262
00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:31.080
Claudia Kozak: The formula is station steps and to therefore grass, a candidate visual poetry in a dynamic visual poetry fashion the world's concept that links numbers I worried capitalism and the tragedy of burning forest ultimately the destroying of life itself.

263
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:41.100
Claudia Kozak: Okay, you can of course explore the world and not wanting to to expand on that I think it would be.

264
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:52.860
Claudia Kozak: worth it, to pay attention not now because I will run out of time, but to pay attention to the the hyperlink in the text in the work that.

265
00:48:53.640 --> 00:49:16.710
Claudia Kozak: leads to a an if statement statement by the Surly on code on coding a he says that the code of Amazon dot H T amp l is i'm quoting now is written in a compressed format often called mini.

266
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:27.990
Claudia Kozak: mini mini five which make it the very difficult to read to convey the idea that the code of this piece was something condensed and obscure.

267
00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:46.170
Claudia Kozak: A Okay, we could we can discuss if you want this work later effort level the colonial that tournaments involvement experimentalism but also interventions in mainstream platform culture related to contemporary social media.

268
00:49:47.040 --> 00:50:07.950
Claudia Kozak: and lead us to this example, which is broken English and online initiative identified itself as a free access digital publishing in davao funded in tooth in 2016 in Mexico by David Martina era and Canada.

269
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:21.600
Claudia Kozak: And ironic toe also be festive resounds all along the side, we can see these, for instance in the motto of broken English loud nika editorial punto.

270
00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:27.330
Claudia Kozak: The one and only publishing house dot l l.

271
00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:39.540
Claudia Kozak: We can easily associate the name of the name broken English with the colonial Chester regarding regarding politics of languages.

272
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:53.370
Claudia Kozak: Because it's an online publishing publishing initiative in Spanish that chooses to name itself not in proper English, but in broken English.

273
00:50:53.910 --> 00:51:05.550
Claudia Kozak: This kind of kind of self reflection and estrangement from mason digital culture also includes the addition of a series of poetry books.

274
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:15.870
Claudia Kozak: And the remediation in the homepage of the Latin American inverted map taking from net dot our Latino database.

275
00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:33.900
Claudia Kozak: A well known pioneer net art, piece by Brian McCann English they you why your Natal this remediated the previously well known, drawing American Bertha showing the mark of the map of South America upside down down by the painter but in regards to.

276
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:46.830
Claudia Kozak: That we can easily relate to the notion of a brief DEMO allergies, of the fans, but all these is interwoven in broken English.

277
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:59.670
Claudia Kozak: With the purest language and raw material that shape nowadays digital culture, since means and bots I have a truly main role in broken English.

278
00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:11.670
Claudia Kozak: If we pay attention to the website visual interface we get the same impression of fusion between experimentalism and mainstream digital culture a fusion.

279
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:29.970
Claudia Kozak: That perhaps enables broken English to be something more than a reproductive commodity, while nevertheless participating or have a new generational sensibility their website homes.

280
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:46.290
Claudia Kozak: Their website homepage chosen sort of 19th interface black screen why Korea new front by the hint that that's not all is shown, both in the brilliant Rien printing letters.

281
00:52:46.590 --> 00:53:05.850
Claudia Kozak: With which serve as hyperlinks and in the disrupted bring reflection that regularly process the screen when clicking in many of these links and explosion of colors fonts comic like high aesthetics and college and colleges interface.

282
00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:08.880
Claudia Kozak: I do not have.

283
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:19.860
Claudia Kozak: Time another is very interesting example in broken English is a digital piece called apple barona poetical my.

284
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:30.180
Claudia Kozak: notes towards in mean means poetic by Chilean poet Jonathan oh paso, which is also behind kumar drawn.

285
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:41.790
Claudia Kozak: and experimental but we refrigerator that releases a unit book of poetry in PDF even with a unique design over each time someone says the site.

286
00:53:42.630 --> 00:54:05.340
Claudia Kozak: OK, I will not refer develop this thing about a this intermediate so but I think it's a very interesting he say you can read about this in the article that I published, I will forget before a finally in my fourth level.

287
00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:22.140
Claudia Kozak: Of a speaker see draft I research that fourth level, which I do not have time here to develop to literally digital activism in indigenous languages phantoms this activism.

288
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:31.560
Claudia Kozak: Only occupies the platforms using indigenous languages, but not the linking from mainstream digital epistemologies.

289
00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:49.650
Claudia Kozak: I do not know in Latin America, any project equivalent, for instance, to john corbett's languages Cree and ancestral code which word third in another panel yesterday, or I don't know remember when but for sure.

290
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:57.840
Claudia Kozak: They activate more languages indigenous network has been growing during the last decade.

291
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.040
Claudia Kozak: So.

292
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:03.390
Claudia Kozak: I.

293
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.560
Claudia Kozak: Okay, there are many things we could.

294
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:09.750
Claudia Kozak: Think about.

295
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:30.240
Claudia Kozak: The the level of decolonization implicating in activism in indigenous languages and the level of not decolonization also implicated there, but I think I will not have time for that finally.

296
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:38.340
Claudia Kozak: My conclusion provisionally is that one of these cases are strictly experimental elite, based on the difficult.

297
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:47.460
Claudia Kozak: The salient Torres or attempts of the colonial mixtures between experimentalism and third generation platform elite.

298
00:55:47.850 --> 00:56:08.100
Claudia Kozak: or digital activism in indigenous indigenous languages, there is an opening for discussing how it might temporarily occupy contemporary platforms, without being completely absorbed by the agenda, so I will stop share.

299
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:38.460
Claudia Kozak: Now, and that's all of my presentation today, but we can open the discussion, I think that, theoretically, my co presenters have really a post very interesting questions and Okay, some are there any thoughts in the chat maybe.

300
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.770
Claudia Kozak: Now little flooded.

301
00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.910
Leonardo Flores: wants to eat.

302
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:48.570
Okay.

303
00:56:50.430 --> 00:57:12.360
Leonardo Flores: let's see i'm trying to read the room let's do it in English and I, since I know there that not everyone speaks Spanish, I want to congratulate you all for a for great great talk great Ted talks I wanted to begin just by just I mean I thought little natalie lael.

304
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:27.060
Leonardo Flores: My talk, I made a really great theoretical framing of everything, and I think one of the questions I have is, and I can ask it in Spanish as well is.

305
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:43.110
Leonardo Flores: And I think Claudia begins to give the answer, so this is a question that may go across several of you, where do you see the space for agency right, because I think we use platforms.

306
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:51.480
Leonardo Flores: But we also grow board right and we also want to transcend them so where I mean.

307
00:57:52.860 --> 00:58:08.100
Leonardo Flores: I think one of the dangers is is is to presume that platforms capture and have this power over us and they do they're designed to do that, but where are the limits of that and where's our space for agency.

308
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:14.310
Leonardo Flores: necessity prophetic a travel club or whatever it.

309
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.450
Leonardo Flores: Is that.

310
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:24.480
Leonardo Flores: They they lose for your patience Okay, no surprise for mama Aquino krakatoa.

311
00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:34.440
Leonardo Flores: cannot for memorial moon in libra a program income when a Casa de la la parameter a.

312
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.520
Leonardo Flores: recipe for know a.

313
00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:46.950
Leonardo Flores: payroll attack a punto but I don't they don't tell him scare a lever that they they.

314
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.450
Leonardo Flores: Are they didn't know either Korea.

315
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:53.460
He.

316
00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.130
Claudia Kozak: Is, but I think that layer so last also post that.

317
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.700
Claudia Kozak: yeah yeah so I can reach.

318
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:03.810
Leonardo Flores: Both of you.

319
00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:04.740
yeah.

320
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:08.700
Leonardo Flores: But, just like right okay.

321
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:10.080
Claudia Kozak: Leo so last.

322
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:10.710
yeah.

323
00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:18.390
Leonardo Solaas: yeah well it's a very high the know depression about agency.

324
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:30.960
Leonardo Solaas: I will take it from the point of subjective experience, I think we have all this experience that we are scrolling through the endless stream of some social network.

325
00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:48.120
Leonardo Solaas: And we, we feel that we are capture, we feel that our attention is captured We feel that we have spent too much time already looking at stuff that is not actually relevant for us, or is repetitive, but somehow we are deprived of our.

326
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:56.070
Leonardo Solaas: willpower we have been our willpower has been replaced by an agency of the system.

327
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:06.570
Leonardo Solaas: So, at that moment, we are clearly out demonized we can we can find it as a as a feeling I think we all know.

328
01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:19.170
Leonardo Solaas: And we also get bored at some point, maybe too late, we we we can extricate ourselves from that experience and look at it from a different point of view.

329
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:40.140
Leonardo Solaas: and say, well, that was too much, I spent too much time on Twitter or Facebook and at that point social status free for what, for what for something else go cooking go for a run read a book whatever which doesn't happen on the platform happens on the on the rest of the world.

330
01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:52.860
Leonardo Solaas: Now us what to do when when when when we get rid of the ultimate decision of the system well my proposal is.

331
01:00:53.700 --> 01:01:05.370
Leonardo Solaas: expressed on on those three forms of freedom is that well, we can still have a relationship with the ultimate icing system from a different point of view.

332
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:16.140
Leonardo Solaas: Which is a critical point of view, which is a point of view, that is made is in another level, we are not inside the system where we are kind of looking at it from a bow.

333
01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:25.890
Leonardo Solaas: Trying to understand this logic and the act of understanding is logic enables a series of new possibilities is a different game, we are not.

334
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:35.970
Leonardo Solaas: playing the game of the system anymore, we are playing our own game about the system, because we can comment on it, we can make our network about it.

335
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:58.440
Leonardo Solaas: We can try to hack it or whatever, which is not part of the original plan of the of the designers of the system so that that is engaging with a system still but in a very different way, with a very different attitude, so that will be my take on this difficult problem.

336
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.670
Agust?n Berti: I can add another thing.

337
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.240
Agust?n Berti: I think it's more explicit on Latin American it.

338
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:17.670
Agust?n Berti: Though it's present in the other forms of it come around i'm not an as an expert, as many people here it's just I was sort of a tourist on elite and and I and.

339
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:28.230
Agust?n Berti: I ended up in philosophy of technology, but it illuminates some of the more relevant issues for fighters with technology and philosophy of digital.

340
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:42.450
Agust?n Berti: But I think that the the political dimension is more explicit on Latin American elite because of their material limitations constraints and need.

341
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:58.800
Agust?n Berti: of innovation or debate or questioning it's on the very nature of the Latin American it I know So yes, that, thank you for the lead form the connection yeah, but I think that.

342
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:01.440
Agust?n Berti: I want to.

343
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:08.430
Agust?n Berti: I found it very interesting when nick's lasik post the thesis that.

344
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:19.470
Agust?n Berti: The platform economy is just another step of capitalist mode of production, so you had for this and then you have autism, and now you have platform capitalism.

345
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:31.050
Agust?n Berti: And there is a continuous it and there is that the old good old the struggle over surplus and the extraction surplus and the problem they he could pose the question of Labor so.

346
01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:47.640
Agust?n Berti: It makes it possible to rethink us previous Latin American literature, made it possible to think it previous that in American literature focused on the left the phone do and the agrarian reform and as.

347
01:03:48.660 --> 01:04:05.430
Agust?n Berti: A primary session of economies, you know it's it's a common trait in in all day let's make a niche right now so from the bottom up to a certain areas to any all the Colombian literature on or maybe Orleans here, and so on, or.

348
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:14.640
Agust?n Berti: You can trace this problem of land ownership and concentration, so I would think that this.

349
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:22.050
Agust?n Berti: The platform economy is another place that literature.

350
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:29.040
Agust?n Berti: may enable thinking attorney broad so that the idea of this wave that we.

351
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:40.440
Agust?n Berti: Try to develop with an eye and it's still an ongoing project aims at this agency, the Agency is in the moment of obfuscating the call.

352
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:57.510
Agust?n Berti: But at the same time that also station is tactical in the sense that it prevents the extraction of surplus or the identification of people or the policing or whatever that form a decision.

353
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:07.410
Agust?n Berti: Making ultimately decision making is running there, but at the same time it's a space for creativity for new forms of.

354
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:18.030
Agust?n Berti: Real or for new ways of relationship on different motor less extractive is less.

355
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:24.870
Agust?n Berti: Violent modes of production, but it's just an intuition and have the answer the question.

356
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:30.780
Claudia Kozak: I think that.

357
01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:48.990
Claudia Kozak: A this notion of an address on addressing this reference yeah really young and the idea of the linking and re inventing a.

358
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.820
Claudia Kozak: From the point for my basis of the linking.

359
01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.140
Claudia Kozak: Our products are productive either way so trying to all I don't know, I was.

360
01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:14.460
Claudia Kozak: Trying to think possibilities for elite and I, I agree with, I will stay in that in Latin American elite, there is a strong.

361
01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:24.990
Claudia Kozak: bias towards politicization a in a geo.

362
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:40.680
Claudia Kozak: Political I know not so not only geographical sense but, for example, i've been working a lot of time during a lot of time on a.

363
01:06:41.400 --> 01:07:00.810
Claudia Kozak: Language geopolitics in Latin American elite, I think this thing is something that we should explore even more, and not only from the perspective of languages as Spanish get to us a potato whatever Portuguese but.

364
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:25.170
Claudia Kozak: programming languages as well that's why I refer to that idea I i'm not sure if there are any programming languages developed in Latin America, which engage with the indigenous indigenous languages, for example, I don't know I really don't know, but this is something that we should.

365
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:38.310
Claudia Kozak: Think, not only in the relation between the global north and the global South but a within the global sound because Spanish and Portuguese are.

366
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:50.820
Claudia Kozak: demonic languages in the region, so we have also they are something, but this ways of going forward or trying to.

367
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:57.630
Claudia Kozak: play against the the machine as closer.

368
01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:22.980
Claudia Kozak: would say, I think, is something that many elite that is everywhere, but in Latin American in Latin America, it shows a bias on geopolitical questions and so on, maybe this is the way I don't know I tried to open possibilities.

369
01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:36.990
Claudia Kozak: Always knowing that within this possibilities there are also the possibilities of being co opted, as I know it in English, the word, since the same called data, I think that.

370
01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:51.570
Claudia Kozak: We should be always aware that this possibility is always there because of that usually experimental artists are always changing places.

371
01:08:52.500 --> 01:09:12.060
Claudia Kozak: Going farther moving around you know because they experimental critical procedures minutes many times are co opted by the the machine itself the system itself as layer so last post these.

372
01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:20.580
Claudia Kozak: out, we have five more minutes even like.

373
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:36.990
Agust?n Berti: I have a small case of what Leo was wondering, the within the platforms regarding taste, I remember a poem by Mr T turtle seated I never know how to pronounce his name.

374
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:39.390
Agust?n Berti: Who support from.

375
01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.230
from Argentina.

376
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.530
Agust?n Berti: The there was a.

377
01:09:45.030 --> 01:10:01.260
Agust?n Berti: An illegal police police repression in the south overland ownership, no Maputo communities were demanding world you're buying a land from a wealthy landowner and they were being I don't know what what is the verb in English that kicked out of the land.

378
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:12.960
Agust?n Berti: So in this context of violence, a young man white European descent young man activists that was there, went missing.

379
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:23.190
Agust?n Berti: He he was found drowned in the River two months later, so there was a it was a manicurist first this about a seal you know I said, with all the.

380
01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:38.100
Agust?n Berti: Employees so Warren has in Argentina, which was some del mondo now, and he posted there was a lot of questions to bring the government employee involved the government in providing answers as to where was this young man.

381
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:53.130
Agust?n Berti: and his poem was the broken image in Facebook, you know the the icon where where the picture is missing, and if you scroll over the picture in Facebook.

382
01:10:53.910 --> 01:11:06.240
Agust?n Berti: The text the caption of the picture would say in this place, there should be the picture of a young man and he described the very popular the image that had been popularized by the.

383
01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:20.070
Agust?n Berti: Family and the people that were requesting the orange to look for him and he described very politically his face, which was not there, as it wasn't a on.

384
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:30.330
Agust?n Berti: As he was missing in other time so that that was in Facebook, so he was so subverting the Facebook main hit.

385
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:38.850
Agust?n Berti: What made Facebook famous for that was showing pictures, you know, he was showing the non picture of this person that was missing, and that was just.

386
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:51.210
Agust?n Berti: A very witty example of subversion within the platforms, making this that didn't work, but when you use slide the mouse or the pointer over the the image.

387
01:11:52.980 --> 01:12:06.090
Agust?n Berti: The porn came out so that's just a little example of these disputes and small agencies within the platform that are not about changing the taste, but rather have income updating it.

388
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:08.880
I would say.

389
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.010

392
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:41.640
Claudia Kozak: which we included in the envelope here it's not the same because it's not Facebook, but he remediated I think this is a poem or at least part of it in another one, or maybe it's the same one i'm not sure.
