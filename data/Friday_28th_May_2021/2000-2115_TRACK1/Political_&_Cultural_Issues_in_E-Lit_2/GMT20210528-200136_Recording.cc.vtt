00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When we start the recording now I think so.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, it's recording so welcome everybody.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hello, everybody. Welcome.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Okay, we will start just now. A, I wanted to, to welcome everybody. And to say that the name of this panel is platform ization and the colonial elite.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Is there any chance, where we discuss the issue of platform ization and kind of culture from a Latin American perspective and the colonial thinking.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Usually the common trait of current platform culture is the maximization of profit by means of gathering data and attention, in order to capture more attention, and more that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In this context, is there any space for pursuing artistic digital activism, and the colonial Elliot.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Okay, the presentations will try to answer these questions, even if in a provisional way.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
People presenting here are learner so last, I will send birthday and I read on myself.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The panel will be Spanish, English based in a sort of tentative of linguistic decolonization of our own. It failed. Each one of us will have 10 minutes for presenting, and then we will open the discussion, but feel free to make comments or post questions

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000
on the chat, and we will try to go back to them after the presentations. So, Leonardo you have the word.

anyway. So I will share my screen.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Nick What do you notice when we check it out is yes, good ask you, Leo. Thank you very much. Now it's the turn off I will think we have, you have set the theoretical framework for all of us.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So now I will think we'll continue with them.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So thank you, Leo for setting up.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Yes, the theoretical framework.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We had this plan to switch back and forth from Spanish to English so I had the burden of speaking in English, so I apologize in advance for that for my bit in English.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I have written short se which is available on the platform. If anyone is interested.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
My English is much better in writing, and in speaking.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So, digging on from from Leo's abroad and losers idea, I will present some intuitions that we've been currently discussing between the four of us in several events and courses or scholarly and not so scholarly places we share it, so it seems that the

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I just wanted to review the idea of let the phone yo which is a very common trope in Latin American literature.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:43.000
With regards to the platforms, so I will just try to make a provocative an analogy, of course, is just sort of game, in order to think, the possibilities and try to think platforms as a form of land, only.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So, my intervention is called the country and the platform, taking home from rain Williams TechCrunch in the city, or the issue of nano phone via either no way this is not sharing the screen.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Okay. Yes.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So some basic assumptions on what digital literacy, digital culture is it before getting into elite.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
First of all, what.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
There are some assumptions, I would like to challenge.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:28.000
First of all, that this is a literal digital culture is not a process of de materialisation, and we duty, but rather process of miniaturization and acceleration.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:43.000
With that miniaturization, which takes place on servers, and on networks, makes way for large economies of scale, which are based on data collection and data processing.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:56.000
These data collection is allowed by this infrastructure that I mentioned before, which operates according to standards standards are themselves a problem.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
An epistemological problem worthy of attention.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I come, basically, from philosophy of technology and it is an important discussion going on on standards in philosophy.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And so, digital reproducibility of cultural forms which operates in this form of standards of digital standards, reduces cultural forms to unspecific forms of digital content, I will not get too much into these because I discussed it elsewhere.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:47.000
But I'm just thinking critiquing here, the idea of convergence culture, by Jenkins which is very popular.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So, what has happened is that convergence content covered convergence culture has expanded the ideas of culture based on authorship and copyright.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:21.000
presentation. That depends on the corporate control of huge collections of digitized and digital content, which create these lawyers economies of scale.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So, I in my request a quote, Please natural history, where he predicts the idea is one of the first and theoretical approaches to a critique of massive landowning or let the formula, which has characterized the history of Latin America.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Until now, it has been associated associated to extract the wisdom. And so I think it's a resumes it summarizes, many of the conflicts that underlie Latin American literature, and which are frequent when one studies Latin American literature.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But such conflicts were also present in English literature, as well as we bring on Williams book, the country the city which I quoted earlier suggests.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:33.000
So, my thesis is now that since the phone yet still exists, of course. But also, now we are migrating to us a new landscape where there is an another form of London which is none of them.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:43.000
So, what are the roots of nano phone Yeah, I will. I would characterize use nano phone to characterize major cultural platforms.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
The roots of the phone there are the illusion of the materialisation, which is actually as I said form of miniaturization.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:10.000
The heads of democracies democratization and freedom of speech that end up in just being freedom of input as anyone who uses Facebook may very well know, the emergence of a new form of activism, which is known as extremism.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:34.000
They alleged universal accessibility ending up in a form of stratified accesses, which scholarly journals, exemplify very clearly, but also all the forms of paywall and restricted surface access, and the siren chance of optimization and rationalization

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:44.000
which started in the late 70s, but with the neoliberal economy model of

00:20:44.000 --> 00:21:07.000
taking over the, the economical rationality. In that in precarious labor or lean platforms, specific characteristic them, which are fueled by bike of Lord and collaborator on cars as an Uber or homes, as in Airbnb, or other forms of surplus extraction.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:19.000
So, that is a, I think, a continuation of the concentration of land or property. If your hands.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000
And that concentration is characterized by form of a me

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:42.000
by the presence of the say fragile entities migrant entities, either be them workers, or a works in either form.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Extra activism also operates in the real world and it has effects on the real world. I heard some keynotes very, especially the keynote on read books, which took this impact into consideration.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And the, the extension of digital technologies, is also based on their orientation of the global south, which in the end, tense ends up being just google Western colonialism, in a new form.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So this modernization promises, end up being just what we always knew. Now, we will Cooper want cope with it, US Elon Musk's bluntly, puts it.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:44.000
So, my question and I will be finishing with this is, is there possible to develop a geopolitics of illiterate or taking on from Jameson's idea of God.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
And instead, geopolitical aesthetics.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:05.000
So, my claim is that if there is to be a geopolitics of electronic literature, the struggles will be about national and regional digital infrastructures and the local regulations over, or trying to cope with the globalized attention economy.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:22.000
The problem is about how much can we tolerate the expansion of cultural Napoleon. And I think it has a lot to say here because as Neil, put it, it's the place where things go beyond what they are programmed to be or might be.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So with an iron brave who will follow after me with

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
try to identify the specifics of

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:44.000
this kind of breaking the rules of the apparatus or opening the blood black box in the context of electronic literature and other forms of digital culture.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And we developed the concept, the concept of an address, which means making impossible, the algorithmic appropriation of works, or content or Well, they trying to prevent words from becoming near content.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:17.000
So that this has been identified as a form of resistance, but also a form of creativity I think and I will get a little bit deeper on that.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And to close my presentation I would say that my intuition is that a literature is a fertile ground to the for developing other forms of digital culture.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Different. Sorry.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
I wanted to avoid going over my time too much.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:56.000
So, I was saying my intuition is that a literature is a fertile ground for developing forms of digital culture, other than platform capitalism towards a fair redistribution of digital space that is a politic and an aesthetic for the nano comments, as

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
to. Thank you very much.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:08.000
So whoever has lived in Latin America will recognize probably this album.

Then with us NC media. That's what I don't think that's the only,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
which is yes and I thank you very much. And now it's my turn.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:35.000
It's okay we are okay with the time I hope and we have several minutes to the open the discussion.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Okay, so my, I will share my screen here.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So, are you watching my screen,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
but not in

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Syria in Korea. Yeah. Okay.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:19.000
So, I would focus. Okay, thank you very much. I will focus on Latin America and elite that particularly engaging because drafting the linking and disruptively occupying contemporary platform culture.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
This is a short presentation so I will not develop my theoretical framework.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
I would have been working with the theoretical framework.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:54.000
That is part of the colonial thinking in the way Walter Mineola elaborated or even the epistemologies of the South coined by the term was coined by voluntourism so Santos, these authors do not necessarily refer to the colonization regarding digital culture,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:08.000
but they certainly give us a point of departure, in terms of what the noise notion of the colonization means in order to not vandalize it or flatten.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I've already written published an NSA, er, earlier this year, and I will give you the link. If you want to read it.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
But shortly. I will, how. Okay.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Here you have only a few quotes from them only from Mineola and an evil econo who media manuals, quoting also just in order to intro that this idea of the linking, which is the main idea I will try to post.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Now, the idea that we need.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Okay. He begins with an eye on it but anyway.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:19.000
They do that we need the need for politically under disturbing the linking comes here to the fore, as do the colonizing knowledge and the colonial knowledge is as necessary steps to imagining and building democratic and non Imperial colonial society doesn't

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:41.000
know they do that, they did colonial, the colonial shift is a project of the linking in Spanish, the linking, in a way, it is Associate associated with this idea of econo they they spend their spirit of inclusiveness.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:58.000
They'll Atlassian Allah, Masha Allah, Allah colonial era in America Armenian definitive icon total power capacity to either legacy to leave a sentence dividends, but given that this panel is like a mix in English and Spanish.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:09.000
The stress I put here on Mineola choice of this particular verb in English is not without implications to the link.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
In English, means to break the connection between something on something else.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:33.000
But the noun and not to the delinquent also exist to refer to a person or maybe to qualify a behavior tending to commit crime particular myelogram in Spanish.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:50.000
The thing is different because Spanish speaking people thought, kind of had to associate this English word to it's a disruption, like something that is out of law, meaning.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Since belling Gil in Spanish, only and only means to break the law.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:22.000
So, it's like, we can, we hear that word in English, but we did codify this word in Spanish, changing the meaning then the main meaning the word has. And, as you may know what the Mineola is an Argentinian, who has been teaching in the United States since

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
the 80s. So, I think, this. panel.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I think he's also very aware of these nuances of the, of the world.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Okay.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
As you see my approach.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Today is kind of a cultural and linguistic one. According to the title of my, my presentation that suggests that besides the linking.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:04.000
We can also bond, the colonial thinking to a more activist way of conceiving that the colonial sheets in terms of occupying colonial spaces.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
The idea of occupy the streets, of course, is behind this.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:21.000
However, the similarities between occupying the streets and occupying digital platforms have its limit.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:41.000
There's several similarities but there are differences I cannot go farther, but the potential empowerment of the people, and emancipator is social transformations that in certain circumstances, Mike derived from occupying streets are usually more tangible,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:42:03.000
that the MC but the potentials that might derive from just occupying digital platforms, and I wanted to stress, just occupy and I have a Chilean example but I don't have time to everything Chilean it's something about this, but I don't have time to develop

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
it.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Anyway, my main argument.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:28.000
build.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:51.000
but that would not mean death to occupy the platforms as they are occupied the platforms means to be there. I know, but also to the link to deviate, and to open up ways of seeing and deal with what digital platforms culture means while we are there, and,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:00.000
ultimately, it means to invent new platforms, and they structural base as well.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:15.000
So, in regards to Latin American League. I think we can enumerate listed some, but also different differentiate some possible paths.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
One of them would be a complete change regarding means of production.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:35.000
But is there any chance for live to do something else. In the meantime, before, if ever, that change occur occurs.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:55.000
The other way would be to explore experimental political digital literature. The keep the language is activism and sort of interventions, of the on the digital machine, as a whole or in part.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Third Level could be exploring the colonial discernment involved in experimental isn't, and even interventions in mainstream platform culture related to contemporary social media.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And the fourth level, could be digital activism in indigenous indigenous languages. I will only refer to the second and the third level of efficacy of these roads.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:50.000
I'm thinking of levels because maybe the extreme efficacy would come if we, if we could change infrastructures, as I was didn't told us. But in the meantime, I will refer.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:00.000
For example, to this second level of frequency, which is close to the first one.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:27.000
I think we can find many, many examples in a Latin American elite of experimental political digital literature, some digital languages activism programming languages activism included and the elite that intervenes the digital machine as a whole or in

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
part.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:46.000
I'm thinking here in elite works that not only the familiarize digital environments, and they are for dances, but the based on digital languages themselves, and even interrupt the digital apparatus, as a whole.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:46:07.000
In Kenya Disraeli's well now works under the tag of algorithm, politics, such as that are the seven or email body naturally brasileira America naughty or Amazon or perhaps the more vivid examples, but also other words by the family, which clear intervene

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:27.000
in the realm of the means of production for into instance certain autonomous digital infrastructures, like, aka was he defines aka boss, as an open source mobile web platform for the collaborative creation of maps and community memories.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
The same for environments with low or no connectivity.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Here you have an image of Amazon.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I think this work can give us some hints for these options within the second level of disruptive efficacy. Again, we have here at it with many nuances, Amazon for the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, which is being clear cut at the rate of three football

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:16.000
fields per minute, but also for one of the most symbolic global corporations, of these 21st century, which literally honoring its name began as a company devoted to the global online selling of printed books, using paper, of course, except product of

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:31.000
the same deforestation, a corporation that has diversified nowadays in huge proposed proportions into a universal production of digital audio visual content.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Every day, I go live and flow.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:58.000
In other words, in other words, to make visible, the linking between all the components of the work called as a vector I'm quoting a vector that transforms your desires into that third capital son, and even fastest were men machines, Amazon, the default

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:11.000
work, work makes the city the code, leading us to do something else that clicking to execute it be just a small step in between.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:29.000
The formula is station steps, and to their progress, a kinetic visual poetry in a time that visual poetry passion the words concept that links numbers algorithms capitalism and the tragedy of burning forest.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Ultimately, the destroying of life itself.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Okay. You can, of course, explore the world, and not wanting to extend on that. I think it would be worth it to pay attention, not now because I will run out of time but to pay attention to the hyperlink in the text in the work that leads to an estate

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
that statement by this early on code on coding.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:31.000
A. He says that the code of amazon.ht ML is I'm quoting now is written in a compressed format, often called mini, mini, mini five, which makes it very difficult to read to convey the idea that the code of this piece was something condensed and obscure.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
A. Okay, we could, we can discuss, if you want this work later.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:50.000
A third level, the colonial that tournaments involved in experimental ism but also interventions in mainstream platform culture related to contemporary social media

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:09.000
lead us to this example, which is broken English, an online initiative identified itself as a free access digital publisher, they were founded in 2000, in 2016, in Mexico, by David Martinez, and Canada.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:23.000
And I only told also bit festive resounds all along the side we can see these for instance, in the motto of broken English loudspeaker editorial punto, lol.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
The one and only publishing house that LL.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:43.000
We can easily associate the name of the name broken English with a D colonial Jester regarding regarding politics of languages,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:51:04.000
because it's an online publishing publishing initiative in Spanish, that chooses to name itself, not in proper English but in broken English. This kind of kind of self reflection and estrangement from Mason digital culture also includes the addition of

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:25.000
a series of poetry books, and the remediation in the homepage of the Latin American inverted map, taken from net dot our Latino database. A well known pioneer net, our piece by Brian McCann in which there you are your net artist remediated the previously

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:37.000
well known growing American better theater, showing the mark of the map of South America upside down, down by the painter, hoping

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:59.000
that we can easily relate to the notion of a piece of technology of the sounds. But all these is interwoven in broken English with the purest language and raw material that shape nowadays, digital culture, since means, and bots have have a truly main

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:15.000
role in broken English. If we pay attention to the website visual interface, we get the same impression of fusion between experimentalism amazing digital culture, a fusion

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:30.000
that perhaps enables broken English to be something more than a reproductive commodity, while. Nevertheless, participating off a new generation of sensibility.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Their website homes, their website homepage chosen sort of 19th interface, black screen white, Korea, new front, but the hint that that's not all, is shown, both in the brilliant green twinkling letters with, which serve as hyperlinks.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:53:09.000
And in the disruptive green reflection that regularly process the screen. When clicking in many of these links and explosion of colors, fonts comic like high stakes and call it, and colleges interface.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:33.000
I do not have time, another very interesting example in broken English is a digital piece called a pompous Barona political moment notes, towards in mean means poetic by Chilean poet, Jonathan Oh Paso, which is also behind Kuma Tron and experimental but

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:43.000
we refrigerator, that releases a unit book of poetry in PDF, even with a unique design cover each time someone that says the site.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Ok, I will not refer develop this thing about this intermediate Eastside but I think it's a very interesting, so you can read about these in the article, I published, I referred before.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Finally, in my fourth level of secrecy draft. I will say that fourth level, which I do not have time here to develop to literally digital activism in indigenous languages.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Sometimes this activism.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Only occupies the platforms, using indigenous languages, but not the linking from Mason digital epistemologies. I do not know in Latin America, any project equivalent for instance, to john Corbett's languages Cree and ancestral code, which were referred

00:54:45.000 --> 00:55:03.000
in another panel yesterday or I don't know. Remember when, but for sure they activate my land was in deaconess network has been growing during the last decade.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
So, I.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Okay, that many things we could think about the level of decolonization implicating in activation in indigenous languages, and the level of not decolonization also implicated there, but I think I will not have time for that.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Finally, my conclusion provisionally is that one of these cases are strictly experimental elite based on the difficult this alien Doris or a sense of their colonial mixtures between experimentalism and third generation platform elite, or digital activism

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:06.000
in indigenous indigenous languages, there is an opening for discussing how it might temporarily occupy contemporary platforms, without being completely absorbed by the agenda.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
So, I will stop share.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Now, and that's all of my presentation today, but we can open the discussion. I think that, theoretically, my co presenters have really a post very interesting questions and.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Okay. Some are there any thoughts in the chat, maybe.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Lil lil Flores wants to eat. Okay.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Let's see, I'm trying to read the room. Let's do it in English, since I know there that not everyone speaks Spanish. I want to congratulate late you all for for a great, great talk, a great set of talks.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:14.000
I wanted to begin, just by just, I mean, I thought, no matter the layer.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:28.000
My talk I made a really great theoretical framing of everything. And I think one of the questions I have is, and I can ask it in Spanish as well, is.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:36.000
And I think Gloria begins to give the answer. So, this is a question that may go across several of you.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Where do you see the space for agency.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Right. Because I think we use platforms.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.000
But we also have bro board right and we also want to transcend them.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:58:05.000
So, where I mean, I think one of the dangers, is, is, is to presume that platforms, capture and have this power over, and they do they're designed to do that.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:20.000
But where are the limits of that. And where's their space for agency necessity prophetic a travel calibre will cover it.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:50.000
They lose where you're being so K, no software can offer mama Akiko Graca Dortmunder can offer mama Libra, a program income, we're not Casa de de la LASAT movement for no, a pair or attack a punto, but I don't.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:07.000
is a career. But I think that layer so last also post that yeah yeah so I mean rich, both of you. Yeah.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
But just elaborate right.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Okay, Leo so last. Um, yeah well it's very high the No, depression, about agency.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I will take it from the point of subjective experience, I think we have all lived this experience that we are scrolling through the endless stream of some social network.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:51.000
And we are, we feel that we are capture, we feel that our attention is captured we feel that we have spent too much time already looking at stuff that is not actually relevant for us or is repetitive but somehow we are deprived of our willpower.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
We have been our willpower has been replaced by an agency of the system.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So, at that moment, we are clearly optimized, we can we can find it as a feeling I think we all know.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And we also get bored at some point, maybe too late. We can extricate ourselves from that experience, and look at from a different point of view, and say, well that was too much.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I spent too much time on Twitter or Facebook. And at that point, solution set us free for what for what for something else. Go cooking, go for a run, read a book, whatever, which doesn't happen on the platform happens on the, on the rest of the world.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Now, us what to do was when when when we get rid of the ultimate ization of the system. While my proposal is expressed on the, on those three forms of freedom is that, well, we can still have a relationship with the ultimate icing system from a different

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:22.000
point of view, which is a critical point of view, which is a point of view that is meta is in another level. We are not inside the system, where we are kind of looking at it from a bow, trying to understand this logic and the act of understanding is logic

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:37.000
enables a series of new possibilities, is a different game. We are not playing the game of the system anymore we are playing our own game, about the system, because we can comment on it, we can make a network about it.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:56.000
We can try to hack it, or whatever, which is not part of the original plan of the, of the signers of the system. So, that, that is engaging with the system still, but in a very different way with a very different attitude.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So, that will be my take on this difficult problem.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I can add another thing which I think it's more explicit on Latin American elite though its present in the other forms of elite come around, I'm not an as an expert as many people here I just I was sort of a tourist on elite and and i and i ended up in

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:31.000
in philosophy of technology, but he he low minutes, some of the more relevant issues for fighters with technology and philosophy of digital.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:53.000
But I think that the the political dimension is more explicit on Latin American elite, because of their material limitations constraints, and needs of innovation or debate or questioning it's on the very nature of the Latin American elite I know.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So, yes, that.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Thank you for the lucky phone connection yeah but I think that I want to, I found it very interesting when Nick's LASIK post the thesis that the platform economy is just another step of copy that is mode of production.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:31.000
So, you have for this and then you have autism, and now you have platform capitalism. And there is a continuing at and there is the the old good old struggle over surplus and the extraction surplus and the problem that he could pose the question of labor,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:52.000
so it makes it possible to rethink us. Previous Latin American literature, made it possible to think it. Previous Latin American literature focused on the let the phone do, and the agrarian reform, and the primary session of economies, you know it's it's

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:08.000
a common trait in, in all the legendary conditions right now. So from the bottom up to a random set of areas to any all the Colombian literature or no audience yeah and so on.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:18.000
You can trace this problem of land ownership and concentration. So, I would think that this.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The platform economy is another place that the illustrator may enable thinking alternative road so that the idea of the slave that we try to develop with an eye and it's still an ongoing project aims at this agency, the agency is in the moment of of escaping

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
the call.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But at the same time that also station is tactical in the sense that it prevents the extraction of surplus or the identification of people, or the policing, or whatever platform, a decision making automated decision making is running there, but at the

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:11.000
same time, it's a space for creativity, for new forms of

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:31.000
real or for new ways of relationship on different modes, less extra activist, less the violent modes of production, but it's just an intuition and of the answers the question though.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I think that a this notion of an address by addressing this reference yeah really fast young, and the idea of the linking and reinventing. A from the, from a basis of the linking

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:14.000
our products are productive I have ways of trying to, I don't know I was trying to think possibilities for a lead and i i agree with Justin that in Latin American elite.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
There is stronger

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
bias towards politics Asian.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:51.000
A in a geo political. I know, not so not only the geographical sense. But, for example, I've been working a lot of time, during a lot of time on a language geopolitics in Latin American elite, I think this thing is something that we should explore even

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:09.000
more. And not only from the perspective of languages as Spanish get to our support Echo, whatever, Portuguese, but programming languages as well. That's why I refer to that idea.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I'm not sure if there are any programming languages, developed in Latin American which engage with indigenous indigenous languages, for example, I don't know I really don't know but this is something that we should think not only in the relation between

01:07:31.000 --> 01:08:00.000
the global not on the global south, but within the global sound, because Spanish and Portuguese are hegemonic languages in the region. So, we have also the or something.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:21.000
would have said say, I think, is something that many elite, that is everywhere, but in Latin American in Latin America, it shows a bias on geopolitical questions and phone, maybe this is the way I don't know.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I tried to open possibilities.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Always knowing that within this possibilities. There are also the possibilities of being called.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I don't know if we knew English they work since the same called battle.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I think that we should be always aware that this possibility is always there. Because of that, usually experimental artists are always changing places, going farther, moving around, you know, because they experiment and political procedures.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Many times are co opted by the, the machine itself, the system itself as layout so last post the.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
If you like.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I have a small case of what Leo was wondering, the within the platforms, regarding taste. I remember a poem by another Tara.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Tara never know how to pronounce his name, who support from from Argentina, that there was an illegal play police repression in the south overland ownership, know the communities were demanding world you're buying a land from a wealthy landowner and they

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:15.000
were being. I know this the verb in English that kicked out of the land. So in this context of violence, a young man, white European descent, young man, activists, that was there went missing.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:29.000
He, he was found drowned in the river. Two months later. So there was a it was a motorist first disability seal, you know I said what the impact is so warm person in Argentina, which was some del mondo now.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And he posted there was a lot of questions to bring the government employee involved the government in providing answers as to where was this young man and he's born was the broken image in Facebook, you know the the icon where, where the victor is missing.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The text the caption of the picture would say in this place there should be the picture of a young man, and he described the very popular the the image that had been popularized by the family and the people that were requesting the Orient to look for

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
him.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And he described very politically his face, which was not there, as it wasn't on as he was missing in other time.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So that was in Facebook. So he was so subverting the Facebook main hit.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:48.000
What made Facebook famous for that was showing pictures, you know, he was showing the non picture of this person that was missing. And that was just a very witty example of subversion within the platforms, making these that didn't work but when you use

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
slide the mouse or the pointer over the, the image.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The porn came out so that's just a little example of these disputes and small agencies within the platform that are not about changing the taste, but rather of incriminating it.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I would say, Hey, I know North Sea turtles work is in the Antelope Valley Philip Pullman owner, and the, the image of Santo Maldonado is part of one of his poems, which we included in the envelope here.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's not the same because it's not Facebook, but he remediated, I think this same poem, or at least part of it. In another one, or maybe it's the same one.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I'm not sure.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So you can you can check this work in envelope here, the lead, volume, no, no.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.000
So, is there any question in the chat possible.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Yes, poems in Facebook. Three the poems in Facebook.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Okay, so I'm not sure.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Chat. So yeah, we'll see ya know, smart things when they're so there. Okay.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:54.000
So, I will have to read the chat now, but anyway. So, if there any more questions. I will like to thank you all very much. Because this is just one of the last panel.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Yellow conference.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:09.000
2021, and they. Okay, I think we see you around somewhere.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I know these and difficult in this car yes but the thing is, passes away the car. Yes, Yes, or you can finish by noon in cages tobacco tobacco fit into usable by surprise.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Say, they'll probably my,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:37.000
my bodies are practical and they asked at a casino Allah, don't drink process.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:15:07.000
A Ebola down to Tampa discord in Florida, that amino acid in
