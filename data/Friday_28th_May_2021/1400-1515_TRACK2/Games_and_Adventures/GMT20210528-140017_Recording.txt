00:12:26	Anastasia Salter:	Cool, welcome to ELO! :-D
00:12:48	Stuart Moulthrop:	WelcomeQ
00:13:05	Stuart Moulthrop:	That is, Welcome!
00:24:38	Leonardo Flores:	Iqra (if I may): you have found your community. We understand what you’re talking about!
00:25:12	Mark Marino:	welcome!
00:27:01	Stuart Moulthrop:	And we (ELO) should organize more specifically cross-national/cultural responses to e-lit.  I'd be fascinated to know what Iqra would say about Tender Claws' PRY, for instance.
00:29:32	Stuart Moulthrop:	Maybe a *western* writer... ?
00:30:20	Alex Mitchell:	I wonder if it would be useful to also consider older (oral/folktale) versions of red riding hood in this analysis?
00:30:51	Dene Grigar:	6 words
00:31:04	Mark Marino:	small plug for Flight Paths by Kate Pullinger, Pakastani émigré might be of interest
00:31:09	Alex Mitchell:	(Sorry its late here and people are sleeping so no microphone)
00:31:45	Alex Mitchell:	thanks!
00:33:10	Mark Marino:	we were talking about how Little Read Riding Hood becomes a Loren Ipsum for some digital narrative communities.
00:33:29	Stuart Moulthrop:	One of the reasons we need more nation-crossing: platform differences -- sms novels vs flash/shockwave, e.g.
00:35:00	Mark Marino:	aka the Moulthrop days
00:35:29	Stuart Moulthrop:	Mock when you say that.
00:35:52	Mark Marino:	only with affection
00:37:27	Mark Marino:	i like the place of family in this talks, lots of active parents in this conference, i mean also simultaneously parenting while attending
00:39:44	iqra khurshid:	thank you very much everyone for such a warm welcome. yeah I am also sending my work to the inanimate alice map, that will present Pakistan as well in that map
00:40:15	Mark Marino:	Takinf your kids back to the old neighborhood
00:40:16	Stuart Moulthrop:	I've finally decided I should have been an anthropologist.  Archeology, definitely.
00:40:57	Mark Marino:	or a mixologist
00:41:20	Stuart Moulthrop:	Twine is gin, yes.
00:42:05	Dene Grigar:	What a great project to undertake
00:43:23	Mark Marino:	this call to mind Invisible Rendezvous
00:43:55	Stuart Moulthrop:	les messageries roses
00:44:22	Leonardo Flores:	I remember becoming aware of CompuServe when a visiting professor from the US came to Puerto Rico. At the time, I was using Gopher.
00:44:38	Leonardo Flores:	And MUDS
00:45:08	Dene Grigar:	I have quite a few of these in my colletonl
00:45:11	Dene Grigar:	collection
00:45:20	Stuart Moulthrop:	Shoot, a "rare screenshot."  Quick, make it a NFT.  Then send us some $$$.
00:46:19	Mark Marino:	lolcat
00:47:03	iqra khurshid:	thank You Alex, I just noted the recommendation and would be working on it and extend it
00:47:19	Stuart Moulthrop:	So good that Judy M is on this one.
00:47:41	Mark Marino:	The Well!
00:48:08	Mark Marino:	Good thing platforms are so much more permanent these days
00:48:48	Stuart Moulthrop:	Heh heh.  I guess you haven't heard about Facebook shutting down this morning.
00:48:55	Stuart Moulthrop:	Sorry, that was a dream.
00:49:30	Judy Malloy:	Yes this is fascinating!  Leonardo's early electronic publications were also on CompuServe (in addition to The Well and via email.
00:49:50	Leonardo Flores:	The impact of fantasy and RPGs is so strong.
00:50:09	Leonardo Flores:	I wish I had had early publications in CompuServe. ;-)
00:50:27	Mark Marino:	i backup my content on betamax tapes
00:50:57	Stuart Moulthrop:	And then you land on the Moon.
00:52:03	Stuart Moulthrop:	HypnoSpace SOOO stole Judith's concept.  (In a nice way.)
00:52:15	Anastasia Salter:	Interesting how the for programmers / for writers dichotomy goes back to the earliest tools.
00:53:42	Alex Mitchell:	Yes that’s fascinating
00:54:18	Leonardo Flores:	Wow <CR>
00:54:38	Leonardo Flores:	Still channeling typewriters
00:54:45	Alex Mitchell:	I remember Turbo Pascal… :O
00:55:05	Leonardo Flores:	I learned to program in BASIC and Turbo Pascal
00:55:11	Leonardo Flores:	In high school
00:55:19	Judy Malloy:	This is awesome!
00:56:06	Jill Walker Rettberg:	I love how the subtitles put “endured an MS DOS environment” instead of “entered…”
00:56:10	Anastasia Salter:	Haha, Turbo Pascal was the first one they taught in my school too.
00:56:18	Daria Petrova:	@Leonardo, Russian schoolchildren are still study Turbo Pascal)
00:56:27	Leonardo Flores:	Wow. So cool.
00:56:34	Anastasia Salter:	We had to print out the programs for grading because our teacher didn't have email...
00:56:37	Stuart Moulthrop:	Now we have Plug-In Hybrid Pascal.
00:57:14	Leonardo Flores:	Mexica by Rafael Perez y Perez is programmed in Pascal.
00:57:49	Leonardo Flores:	I sense Hitchiker’s Guide echoes.
00:58:20	Stuart Moulthrop:	"...before you start living this life..." (With Those we Love Alive)
00:59:18	Daria Petrova:	Bytes)))
01:01:01	Stuart Moulthrop:	Dead Sea floppies.
01:06:13	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	that was applause
01:06:15	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	:)
01:06:21	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	no questions at the moment!
01:06:33	Leonardo Flores:	The sound of one hand clapping.
01:08:41	Stuart Moulthrop:	I really love the through-line from WELL to CompuServe in Judy's and Judith's projects.
01:10:39	Dene Grigar:	we are racing against time
01:12:29	Anastasia Salter:	Recalling Jason Scott's warning (http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/3191) the degradation of what hasn't been thrown out is also working against this type of preservation.
01:12:48	Anastasia Salter:	Can't believe the post I was thinking of is also a decade old now...
01:13:01	Leonardo Flores:	https://elmcip.net/
01:13:34	Stuart Moulthrop:	Or instead of archiving, we could just put all our efforts into time travel...
01:13:56	Leonardo Flores:	We’d probably contaminate the timeline.
01:15:08	Mark Marino:	We are all Ozymandias
01:15:25	Stuart Moulthrop:	I thought somebody was Hercules.
01:17:29	Colin Post:	I think part of the challenge here is that academic archives are oriented around collecting the materials of individuals and not communities -- we need new frameworks to collect/document virtual communities and not just individual creators
01:17:44	Leonardo Flores:	The NEH (etc) won’t fund preservation of works that are in a grey area regarding copyright.
01:18:10	Stuart Moulthrop:	I miss communism.
01:18:15	Leonardo Flores:	But we can wait another 50 years for public domain access. ;-)
01:18:43	Leonardo Flores:	Agreed, Colin.
01:19:13	Colin Post:	there are ethical frameworks around web archiving (like DocNow) that could be applied to pre-web internet archiving
01:19:45	Colin Post:	https://www.docnow.io/
01:20:23	Stuart Moulthrop:	"We are all alive in Joyce's head."  (One friend of James Joyce to another, circa 1920.)
01:20:38	Leonardo Flores:	I bet there’s sensitive information that she wasn’t aware was sensitive.
01:21:08	Dene Grigar:	Yes, it was just too much stuff
01:23:05	Leonardo Flores:	They probably didn’t have server backups
01:26:08	Leonardo Flores:	We’re going to need a new chapter for this beauty.
01:27:05	Stuart Moulthrop:	OK, next ELO member who makes $1 million on Dogecoin needs to kick some of that back.
01:27:55	Mark Marino:	great presentations!! Can't wait to play the game!
01:28:53	Mark Marino:	you need to talk to their spouses
01:29:11	Mark Marino:	that's who throws away my notes
01:29:29	Mark Marino:	i try to explain that they are a treasure
01:29:36	Mark Marino:	for the world
01:29:44	Mark Marino:	great job
01:29:48	Mark Marino:	keynote
01:29:59	Track Two: Conference Admin:	Keynote is in 10 minutes :)
01:30:01	Alex Mitchell:	Great talks, thanks to both speakers :)
01:30:04	Mark Marino:	coffee in the discord cafe
01:30:09	Stuart Moulthrop:	Excellent talk, friends!
01:30:15	Mark Marino:	it's like a bulletin board
01:30:18	Anastasia Salter:	Thank you both!
01:30:19	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	Thanks everyone!
01:30:20	Leonardo Flores:	Thank you!
