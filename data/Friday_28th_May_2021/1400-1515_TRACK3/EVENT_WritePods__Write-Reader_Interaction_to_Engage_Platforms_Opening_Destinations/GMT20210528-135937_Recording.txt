00:23:33	Samya Roy:	I loved this a lot!
00:24:16	Samya Roy:	I also recommend checking out today's dra.ft exhibit for more insight into Indian E-Lit!
00:24:38	Hannah Ackermans:	The dra.ft exhibit is sooo good!
00:24:58	Samya Roy:	yaaas!
00:25:25	Samya Roy:	They actually referenced my work with ELMCIP and it made me more happy than I believed!
00:28:03	Deena Larsen:	Love the term "passion projects"
00:28:20	Deena Larsen:	We are doing this for our soul! Lovely!
00:29:12	Deena Larsen:	Looking forward to the release of Cinderella :)
00:29:48	Deena Larsen:	Ok ok, initial launch.
00:30:16	Deena Larsen:	Clear groundrules and process!! Hooray!
00:30:32	Deena Larsen:	oh the deadline and peer pressure!
00:30:35	Samya Roy:	Looking forward to Cinderella!
00:30:38	Hannah Ackermans:	YES!
00:31:01	Samya Roy:	Oh yes my idea would never have been finished. I needed a deadline more than anything!
00:31:19	Deena Larsen:	YEs, the internationality was key!
00:32:43	Deena Larsen:	Classify the WritePODS as investments of time... writing workshops with different commitment levels.
00:33:05	Deena Larsen:	Amount of time on the work, and the product that results--
00:33:15	Deena Larsen:	Higher expectations for the written feedback
00:35:30	Deena Larsen:	Expecting readers gives a reason to finish your work, and improves it
00:35:51	Deena Larsen:	4204
00:35:55	Deena Larsen:	420
00:35:58	Deena Larsen:	Farang
00:37:22	Deena Larsen:	We write from our hearts. It is the only reason to do ths.
00:38:04	Samya Roy:	can I take the git hub link?
00:38:26	Deena Larsen:	Process paper is at https://github.com/juliannechat/elit-writepod-process
00:38:46	Deena Larsen:	The fun in elit is creating new art forms every time.
00:38:54	Samya Roy:	<3
00:39:09	Deena Larsen:	content as crutch for people who can not handle process
00:39:43	Deena Larsen:	Do not chair your own reaction session
00:40:11	Deena Larsen:	Let the author manage their 20 minutes--what do you want out of the group/resources
00:40:24	Deena Larsen:	creator controlled spaces/moderator controlled spaces
00:42:43	Deena Larsen:	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ETLOAFl5DU for Samya to watch
00:43:19	Hannah Ackermans:	Can you put the word in the chat, auto-captions says "Frankie"
00:43:30	Samya Roy:	hahahah
00:43:37	Clara Fernandez-Vara:	ferengi
00:43:43	Hannah Ackermans:	thank you!
00:44:04	Samya Roy:	yes!
00:45:47	Deena Larsen:	we are really a family,
00:46:01	Hannah Ackermans:	WritePODs as a gateway drug to ELO you mean?
00:46:12	Samya Roy:	Strong one at that
00:46:19	Deena Larsen:	WRiteOODS as gateway drug. I love it
00:46:25	Deena Larsen:	Let's get more and more addicts!
00:46:50	Samya Roy:	Never have I ever heard a government employee to say that
00:47:21	Deena Larsen:	Digital writepods are more convenient, can add worldwide, relatively short sessions.
00:47:37	Deena Larsen:	Two hours did not feel tiring
00:48:03	Deena Larsen:	Reach an international audience for people who can not travel
00:48:38	Deena Larsen:	Outreach, reach students
00:50:36	Deena Larsen:	Both and!
00:50:43	Deena Larsen:	Follow up to online.
00:50:49	Deena Larsen:	Face to face and follow up.
00:51:16	Samya Roy:	right
00:51:57	Hannah Ackermans:	I'm just taking it all in!
01:00:48	Richard Holeton:	e.g. Bill Dickey erotica :)
01:01:13	Deena Larsen:	Good point Richard
01:01:46	Deena Larsen:	Or something that was not safe
01:03:00	Samya Roy:	Even if not an ELO code of conduct there should be a WritePod code of conduct!
01:03:58	Hannah Ackermans:	Yes, Writepods can have there own ground rules at least
01:04:00	Deena Larsen:	Yes, let's do a WritePOD code of conduct--
01:04:10	Deena Larsen:	and we did have ground rules, but we need ground consequences.
01:04:22	Deena Larsen:	Need to be clear about the content accepted
01:04:35	Hannah Ackermans:	yes, ground consequences, good term!
01:06:33	Richard Holeton:	yes “train” moderators/facilitators
01:06:43	Samya Roy:	right!
01:09:19	Richard Holeton:	Hi Alvaro!
01:09:19	Álvaro Seiça:	Thanks! Hello
01:09:52	Jules Chatelain:	Hello! I work for Stephanie Strickland so learned of some of your work through her
01:12:12	Jules Chatelain:	What constitutes feedback << GREAT point
01:12:49	Hannah Ackermans:	That's a good point but there is a difference between difficult topics or work arguing against people's right to exist.
01:12:59	Jules Chatelain:	Hi Winnie! We are discussing our "feedback" research - how to get actionable feedback on works in progress
01:13:28	Winnie Soon:	thanks for getting me into the discussion :) <3
01:14:05	Jules Chatelain:	There were pros and cons
01:15:49	Deena Larsen:	Creative writing mostly
01:19:08	Richard Holeton:	I think it can be hard to come up with an artists statement for a work in progress
01:19:25	Richard Holeton:	(hard even for finished work?)
01:19:30	Samya Roy:	That would be like a reading group
01:19:35	Samya Roy:	writing group
01:21:09	Deena Larsen:	PRopose WRITEPODS--mix of academic and critical worksSpecific genres
01:21:17	Deena Larsen:	How can we get these into reality?
01:21:21	Deena Larsen:	A call for moderators?
01:22:08	Winnie Soon:	I do agree with Clara is to have target audience in mind (esp in academic writing I think)
01:22:10	Deena Larsen:	Safe space for reactions
01:22:41	Winnie Soon:	Yes Hannah I like this intervention , to acknowledge other forms of knowledge production.
01:23:01	Hannah Ackermans:	Thank you, Winnie
01:24:12	Deena Larsen:	Build connections!
01:24:22	Hannah Ackermans:	Maybe train people after they have been a participant and then they can have a new group?
01:24:25	Deena Larsen:	We'll always have Paris.. I mean 2021 writePOD
01:24:44	Deena Larsen:	Other writepods will take what we have and remix and run..
01:25:16	Deena Larsen:	Make this viral, spread the word.
01:26:17	Hannah Ackermans:	You need Deena and Jules' approval to run a WritePod (TM)
01:26:36	Deena Larsen:	ELO offers....
01:26:49	Deena Larsen:	We could offer that ELO could offer... or just be a sponsor...
01:27:19	Deena Larsen:	Groundrules to add:Work would be electronic --have to have something more than text for meaning.
01:27:39	Deena Larsen:	People need to commit
01:27:48	Deena Larsen:	Content needs to conform to Code of Conduct
01:27:56	Samya Roy:	right
01:28:00	Deena Larsen:	Ask for support --bandwidth
01:28:32	Deena Larsen:	Do not need to be a member of ELO
01:28:44	Deena Larsen:	Have writepods before a conference and have an exhibit.
