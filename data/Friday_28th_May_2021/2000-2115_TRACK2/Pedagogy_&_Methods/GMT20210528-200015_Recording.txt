00:35:44	Deena Larsen:	@Forgetful--nope. Haven't seen it.
00:35:56	Mark Marino:	@lorenzoenzoenzo: @chefboyardee, that response seems canned. That’s how she responded to my pasta as well
00:36:08	Elliott Hedman:	Chef Boyardee @Kim Kardashian you've got all the attention even without your face. Your tweets are to die for. But don't worry, I didn't burn the pasta!

00:36:43	Deena Larsen:	@Chef Boyardee, I did not eat the whole thing. Really. I am innocent

00:37:26	Melinda White (she/her):	@lorenzoenzoenzo Love the “canned” response
00:37:45	Deena Larsen:	@lorenzoensoenzo--your name is too hard to type

00:39:20	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Q to Rob: what relationship do you build with your netprov character: empathy or identification?
00:39:32	Melinda White (she/her):	Kim Kardashian: @ Chef Boyardee so humbled you’re reading my tweets. They are sooooo good tho.

00:41:28	Deena Larsen:	George Burns does this best
00:41:31	Andrew Klobucar:	I only tweet to myself…
00:41:36	Esteban Morales:	That was fantastic!
00:44:16	Kenton Taylor Howard:	I'm curious if we could get some examples of some of other stories that are part of Wonder Stories, I have a nephew around that age and it seems like something he would like
00:44:34	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Q Eliott: Can you talk more about how you measured engagement with your Media Lab tool?
00:45:21	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Question @Eleonora and Nathalie :How to educate in digital literacy through kid digital literature (kid elit) ? Can we postulate that teaching digital literature maximally activates the operations involved in any digital reading and, moreover, that is the most relevant form for teaching digital reading and writing ? :-)
00:47:13	Melinda White (she/her):	Multiplying bunnies!
00:48:55	Maria Mencia:	https://lab-yrinthe.ca/actualites/appel-a-participation
00:49:57	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Impressive Elliott!
00:50:07	Elliott Hedman:	Thanks Serge. Appreciate it.
00:50:40	Jeremy Hight:	yay  mit …….sensors and literature...awesome
00:52:30	Deena Larsen:	How do you teach the rhetoric of elit (how links work, how images and text synchronize for meaning, etc.?)
00:53:50	Jeremy Hight:	Elliot what research area at mit?  have you submitted to Leonardo abot your work  and how do you see literature tied to senses and reactivity in your hybrid interests?  not meaning to plug Leonardo btw
00:54:40	Andrew Klobucar:	So we postulate a concept of literacy based in non-linearity? Can you provide one example of a literary skill you want to identify? Maybe with respect to time and how we perceive time?
00:55:51	Jeremy Hight:	sorry I meant yuya
00:56:00	Jeremy Hight:	been zooming here and siggraph
00:59:47	Andrew Klobucar:	I also wonder what Elliott and Nathalie think of Skunk Tales - looking at the words and how they influence a narrative in our heads…
01:05:55	Deena Larsen:	Collaboration is key. Playing with Mark and Rob;s netprov iswonderful
01:07:05	Deena Larsen:	Hypertext IS Multivocal
01:07:11	Andrew Klobucar:	THanks — I see some cool connections, too
01:07:13	Yuya Peco Takeda:	Singling can be downloaded here: https://dlsn.lled.educ.ubc.ca/wordpress/singling/
01:07:19	Jeremy Hight:	ah Elliot  okeydoke
01:07:47	Andrew Klobucar:	http://workbench.gtrlabs.org/
01:09:32	Andrew Klobucar:	I use Singling in my sound art course - the students use it all term long
01:09:53	Jeremy Hight:	Elliot what research area at mit?  have you submitted to Leonardo abot your work  and how do you see literature tied to senses and reactivity in your hybrid interests?  not meaning to plug Leonardo btw
01:09:58	Andrew Klobucar:	They like it better than Logic Pro…. Who knew?
01:10:21	Kedrick James:	Haha, Imagination Pro
01:13:46	Elliott Hedman:	https://www.wonderstories.app/research/redesignremote
01:14:14	Mark Marino:	And Maria is next
01:15:51	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Very good point Rob. And thank you for quoting Perec.
01:16:14	Andrew Klobucar:	Can we get the MIT sensors for ELO 22?
01:16:21	Elliott Hedman:	nice
01:16:29	Kedrick James:	Yes Rob, Perec / OULIPO the procedural precursors to much of E-lit
01:16:37	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	This was great, thank you all!
01:17:30	Rob Wittig:	#secretdiary I made such a stupid comment. I should have kept my mouth shut.
01:17:59	Mark Marino:	#secretdiary: I’m skunk tailing this moderation
01:18:49	Kedrick James:	#secretdiary: I have to figure out the difference between Everyone and Direct Message
01:19:09	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Gestures participate to the construction of meaning of an interactive narrative
01:19:35	Deena Larsen:	We should get an engagement ring
01:19:58	Elliott Hedman:	Kate Hales deep reading?
01:20:09	Deena Larsen:	That is how Serge's face app works
01:20:26	Andrew Klobucar:	My body is so annoying when I am trying to read…
01:20:53	Deena Larsen:	We interact with stories, so we should interact with the screen
01:21:12	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Right, Deena
01:21:33	Andrew Klobucar:	— Mark! No that style of reading comes much later.
01:22:06	Mark Marino:	Does it ever come, Andrew?
01:22:12	Mark Marino:	or is that your point
01:22:26	Deena Larsen:	THe applause is the high point because they are interacting
01:22:39	Deena Larsen:	So the ergodic work is really exciting play
01:22:57	Serge BOUCHARDON:	About gestures: there are "figures of manipulation", when the reader/interactor is facing a manipulation based on a difference between his/her expectations and the display on the screen
01:23:00	Deena Larsen:	Yeah... right...
01:23:04	Andrew Klobucar:	Yes - I think we gradually learn or are trained to associate reading with sitting still and silent
01:23:51	Rob Wittig:	We definitely are trained.
01:25:21	Rachel Horst:	https://dlsn.lled.educ.ubc.ca/wordpress/skunktales/
01:25:40	Rachel Horst:	We experimented with different ways of representing a very diffracted process
01:25:41	Andrew Klobucar:	Scholarship was modelled wasn’t it? off of losing your body… serious readers - I know I was taught that…
01:25:43	Rob Wittig:	Thanks, Rachel!
01:25:48	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Great final panel. Thanks to all participants!
01:25:54	Melinda White (she/her):	Thank you, everyone. These are amazing projects and ideas! I have to go, it is 22 minutes past the dog’s dinner time and she is telling me she may perish shortly!
01:26:25	Andrew Klobucar:	Very good panel! Thanks for the discussion on pedagogy
