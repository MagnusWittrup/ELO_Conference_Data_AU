Mark Marino: Okay, now, I just want to tell you, even if we end early it doesn't mean you guys get to go home no we'll use the rest of the time for fabulous discussion okay that sounds good.

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.830
Mark Marino: Okay, that sounds good alright, so I got my little seven minute timer here and I will put it on.

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:13.860
Mark Marino: So that it makes a noise because i'm too Nice, a person and otherwise I wouldn't interrupt i'd feel self conscious about interrupting you Okay, and then we have our hostess is our host here are done our host from track to host I think is here.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.590
Mark Marino: I don't know they never make it I don't even know if there's someone there they're drinking rum that's like the that's the group was soren.

19
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.810
Mark Marino: i'll assume that maybe there's talking in the chat let me look oh yeah they're they're stuck in the chat oh great great trek to person, whoever anonymous person great um.

20
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:59.460
Mark Marino: And then I really don't buy us for anybody, so I guess i'll have to let you guys introduce yourselves I won't count that towards your seven minutes, unless you are paste them in the chat that's what a lot of groups have been doing it, if you want to paste bios and their.

21
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.690
Mark Marino: Okay, we go.

22
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:30.630
Mark Marino: Okay welcome everybody to this final panel of elo 21 let's give a big round of applause for the end of a terrific conference we're so excited about all the speakers, we have for you today.

23
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:46.080
Mark Marino: we've got four great talks and they're going to give relatively short presentations I see a lot of at least three of them are linked to things where you could go and read them perhaps you've already read them who knows, and then we'll have ample time for discussion.

24
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:59.580
Mark Marino: i'm gonna let the groups, introduce themselves as they will when it comes to their turn, will do all the presentations in sequence, and then we'll have plenty of time for conversation, so thank you all for joining us and don't forget that.

25
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:10.110
Mark Marino: If we don't have enough time for conversation, for whatever reason, this panel goes till 115 of course there's actually nothing after this so, in theory, we can just continue forever, but.

26
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.130
Mark Marino: At when when we get around to 1415 my time actually as to to 15 my time I wrote time it is wherever you are.

27
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.500
Mark Marino: Then you can always send the conversation into the track to discord which will remain at your service.

28
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.530
Mark Marino: Okay, so without further ado i'm going to turn things over to our first group.

29
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.450
Mark Marino: We have.

30
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:45.330
Mark Marino: As I said, with this this panel is called this whole this whole panel is called pedagogy and methods and I, of course, and mark Marino your moderator.

31
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:57.600
Mark Marino: So so let's let's get started with our first presentation by Rachel horse kendrick James Esteban morale is you, you to Qaeda and FM young and they're tight there talk well.

32
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:07.020
Mark Marino: i'll say their talk, but it's called sounding the futures imaginary a collaborative intra modal storing method dollar.

33
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.690
Kedrick James: Thank you very much, mark.

34
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:27.630
Esteban Morales: Thank you for the wonderful introduction and hello, and thank you all for joining us, we are members of the digital literacy Center dlc at the University of British Columbia.

35
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:44.490
Esteban Morales: In Vancouver Canada not Vancouver us in this session will briefly introduce you to cocktails a collaborative feature narrative that we created over the last 14 months, while we were all in the midst of a global pandemic, as you know.

36
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:53.520
Esteban Morales: More specifically, will share with you the methodology which we have created and indeed continue to develop this cocktails.

37
00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:03.060
Esteban Morales: will know should will now share with you this collaborative pathway when we have engaged with multi method multi modal digital techniques to create narratives.

38
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:13.290
Esteban Morales: Each of us will now explain the step of this process, processing, we do, in which you can get the ball by visiting our website, which will share in a moment in the chat.

39
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.300
Yuya Peco Takeda: Our first iteration of this collaborative storing methodology happened in September 2020 at the basement of metrics house, yes, face to face.

40
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.620
Yuya Peco Takeda: In between time of provincial wide lockdowns when regulation with somewhat loosened with the hint of awkwardness we gathered.

41
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:46.020
Yuya Peco Takeda: surrounded by thousands of vinyl records, we started our experimental collaborative future narrative writing in response to the following questions.

42
00:05:46.680 --> 00:06:00.900
Yuya Peco Takeda: What will sound sound like in an increasingly digitized future, how will meaning of technology evolved together and apart, how can we collaborate to believe right the future in a way that allows for multiple perspectives and 10 properties.

43
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:15.330
Yuya Peco Takeda: As we were sitting up the context, a skunk passed by by the window basement window and into our story to universe becoming the central cyborg Ian post human figure of our future future imaginings.

44
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:26.670
Yuya Peco Takeda: We wrote simultaneously allowing the thoughts to come freely we wrote for a set amount of time and then read what we had written allow to each other, around the people.

45
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:45.030
Yuya Peco Takeda: In this way, elements and ideas and characters began to circulate among us, as we will discuss further this cocktails or no right it through the feedback loop of writing reading aloud and certification of the written text fema is going to tell us about how we solidified the texts.

46
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.160
Effiam: to solidify the text that we grow we use singling an application that we developed in the digital literacy Center.

47
00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:10.410
Effiam: We created a software to facilitate the learning and analysis of reading by listening simply takes text as an input to produce sound us to put the audio generated is based on the lexical grammatical properties of the text, which forms the connection between vocabulary and grammar.

48
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:19.770
Effiam: Our second iteration of this collaborative story writing process took place in October 2020 at the auto inquiry research group symposium.

49
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:28.740
Effiam: Continuing from where we left off at tedx House you compose the second chapter of scum tales live this time using sync went to certify the texting real time.

50
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:42.240
Effiam: We wrote me solidified in singling for a certain amount of time, then we copy and paste it will be rotor onto pamphlet where stories can be read in a linear time cadre good now tell us how we can be the Texan differently.

51
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:52.560
Kedrick James: And will take you now to the website, which will put the link for in the chat and on this website, we were.

52
00:07:53.100 --> 00:08:02.340
Kedrick James: Basically, exploring a number of different multimodal ways that we could share the ideas and experiences of a nonlinear futures narrative.

53
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:18.030
Kedrick James: And so, when engages both with the soundscapes we've created by using the narrative and just as an example of one at the different chapters that we created we've taken the work of Jim Andrews and notable electronic literature artists.

54
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:32.760
Kedrick James: His his program called stir fry and in the stir fry text we've gone in and taken the code and allowed the different sections of the text to be Palin c'est over each other so as you scroll over it, you can encounter.

55
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:42.630
Kedrick James: nonlinear presentation of this narrative and through a number of different experiments we've tried to give the reader the same.

56
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:57.690
Kedrick James: generative experience of encountering a nonlinear narrative structure and now we'll talk from rachel's perspective, about how we can how you can in fact engage in this ongoing narrative that we hope will continue until the pandemic is.

57
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.850
Rachel Horst: yeah so through.

58
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.520
Oh.

59
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.600
Kedrick James: It looks like rachel's frozen.

60
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.420
Kedrick James: So maybe we'll just continue that's too bad.

61
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.770
Kedrick James: So we'll just continue until she can join us again.

62
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.870
Kedrick James: In this further stage of this cocktails narrative.

63
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:41.340
Kedrick James: we've created a thing that we've used for a process we call the patch and so we've taken all the words in several chapters that have been generated over several different iterations.

64
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:50.430
Kedrick James: of creating the skunk tales narrative and put them into a version of I read fast, which allows you to adjust the speed of the words that you see.

65
00:09:51.510 --> 00:10:02.400
Kedrick James: And then, if you go down, you can just allow you can enter words that strike you because they resonate for you or you you catch them in your head as they whipped by great speed.

66
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:21.270
Kedrick James: and write them down a little below it if you scroll down you'll you'll see that you can, in fact, then add to the palette the format that we've used for much of the creation of this narrative and generate your own bits of text which we will incorporate into the overall narrative structure.

67
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:29.430
Kedrick James: We look forward to talking with you more about this project and its many different prongs and extensions.

68
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.840
Kedrick James: As we get into the.

69
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.920
Kedrick James: Discussion period so thanks we'll put links in the chat.

70
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.680
Kedrick James: I think that was seven minutes.

71
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.980
Mark Marino: It was great that was great yep all right.

72
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:50.760
Rachel Horst: Go.

73
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.900
Mark Marino: Oh right Rachel do you want to say a few things before you a bonus me if you want.

74
00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:02.940
Rachel Horst: Just apologies that my this that's the one minute that that I lost connection, of course, when i'm speaking so apologies.

75
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:15.600
Mark Marino: yeah it's classic it's classic I thought that was part of the performance, I actually i'm i'm so sorry that happened there, but there will be plenty of time to catch anything you want to add during the chat for sure.

76
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:31.560
Mark Marino: Okay well next up, we have Elliot headman who's going to be presenting improving readers participation and academic engagement with incur inquiry based reading in wonder stories.

77
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:45.720
Elliott Hedman: Thank you, mark hi everyone I am Dr Elliot hadn't been really inspired by everyone's talks and the crazy thing you guys all come up with with what could text look like.

78
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:53.220
Elliott Hedman: I want to show you a small graph here, this is your brains on books.

79
00:11:53.970 --> 00:12:02.550
Elliott Hedman: More specifically, this is the third grade English language learner as he's reading the voyage of the doctor to little I helped invent a sensor at the MIT media lab.

80
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.210
Elliott Hedman: Where we measure emotions and this actually this little Spikes there, those are moments when he's getting engaged but seven minutes in he had Dr D little are not the best of friends in fact.

81
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.730
Elliott Hedman: there's a big drop box plot of drool on first page when we came back and checked in with them.

82
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:28.680
Elliott Hedman: Now Okay, so one kid didn't like reading, but it ends up being the case, in this day and age of 52% of kids that don't want to read, they don't enjoy reading they don't like it.

83
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:37.710
Elliott Hedman: This is a problem, because the number one predictor of a kid's success of reading is how much they enjoy it if you read a lot you're going to do really well at it, but how do we create a world today.

84
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:45.030
Elliott Hedman: When kids have all these ipads and all these Games, where they want to participate, where they want to read that is my big question that i've been trying to research.

85
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:57.570
Elliott Hedman: So we just this kid who read Dr Julian the same day we showed him wonder stories, this is a digital reading tool it's an APP you can download it i'll link it it's wonder stories that APP.

86
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:12.570
Elliott Hedman: When he read wonder sorry this is his skin conductance and that that's every one of those Spikes and him leaning in participating engaging being excited about it my favorite part about his response afterwards was he told me that was a lot like math.

87
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:21.450
Elliott Hedman: So our event, it was almost a finance math for him, that was a weird but you know, for most of these kids they're being told that they aren't good at reading that they don't.

88
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:27.030
Elliott Hedman: That they're stupid or that they can't do it, it comes down to is that they just not given experience with the right stimuli.

89
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.250
Elliott Hedman: We have time i'll show you guys a video of a kid actually reading the.

90
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.070
Elliott Hedman: The wonder stories, but what I do is I do co creation at the boys and girls club here in Denver.

91
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.430
Elliott Hedman: Where we work together with kids and figure out Okay, if you don't like a book, what do you like what should it look like what should electronic book look like.

92
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:51.570
Elliott Hedman: What are finding has happened and what creative wonder stories of even a reading itself might not engage in early reader.

93
00:13:52.020 --> 00:14:01.620
Elliott Hedman: Questions and cognitive thinking is a really great way to engage kids when they actually have to participate and think about things you think oh if you're behind you don't want that, but no, you actually wanted even more.

94
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:09.120
Elliott Hedman: So in wonder story is because we saw these kids loving reading so much we created a bunch of stories and we're solving problems so.

95
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:21.540
Elliott Hedman: Why are all the kids getting sick what what what's rotten what food is run or the spaceship is broken, how do we fix it or one of my favorite questions the bus drivers a dinosaur is she going to eat me.

96
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:28.530
Elliott Hedman: So these kind of questions are the kids going to participate answer questions all reading and cognitively thinking and doing a lot of comprehension with it.

97
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.730
Elliott Hedman: By article goes into a lot of detail over.

98
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:39.960
Elliott Hedman: The last year, I actually ran the literacy program at the boys and girls club that stayed open during covered.

99
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:48.600
Elliott Hedman: And even though I gave questions the kids were kind of engaged, they were kind of there sometimes, but a lot of times I mean I had kids the first day tell me reading sucks I don't want to do this.

100
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:57.210
Elliott Hedman: And what ended up happening as I explored Okay, not only do we need to do, questions, but we need to do more to engage these kids who haven't read a book, sometimes for almost a year.

101
00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.260
Elliott Hedman: And what ended up happening is that when we integrated wonder stories with.

102
00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:10.590
Elliott Hedman: acoustic trivia like game where you can compete with others and get points this sense of social competition had an insane amount of engagement.

103
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.280
Elliott Hedman: I started out with kids not even reading a book I like that one kid to read as soon as they put a hoot in with these questions.

104
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:25.710
Elliott Hedman: I had kids telling their parents who were came to pick them up, that they had to wait outside until they finished reading the book because they need to finish the game.

105
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:32.580
Elliott Hedman: I also had kids asked me, can we read another one, I want to read another book, and these are kids who are multiple grade levels below and hate reading.

106
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:43.890
Elliott Hedman: And all we have to do is reframe reading into a more digitally for you so i'm kind of here kind of challenge, can I see yellow more of an artistic direction but it's like actually digital reading is the future of reading for young kids.

107
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:52.740
Elliott Hedman: I feel very alone in making this argument i'm really excited to be there, marked, we have, I think I think i've talked to like only three minutes we have time to show the video.

108
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.450
Mark Marino: You got you got three more minutes as a.

109
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.150
Elliott Hedman: matter okay guys quick, we got to press the play button.

110
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:05.400
Elliott Hedman: All right, I want you to watch it, I want you to watch this girl here, because this is going to look very different than what a normal reader will look like.

111
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.850
Elliott Hedman: When was the last time you saw a fist pump well I kids reading a book.

112
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:57.390
Elliott Hedman: The problem is that most book for 200 pages about ever feeling a successor achievement and kids, especially those behind need those moments of success and excitement, and in my opinion, digital reading is the future and that's what i'm working on.

113
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.310
Elliott Hedman: Thank you guys.

114
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.400
Mark Marino: All right, thank you very much.

115
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:12.150
Mark Marino: That was excellent wow i'm already seeing all the lines of flavor connection between all these talks it's almost like a.

116
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:23.520
Mark Marino: Perfectly put together panel alright so next up, we have Eleanor a Sarah and natalie lists out and they're going to be presenting.

117
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:41.250
Mark Marino: And I apologize for not pronouncing their title correctly i'll say a lab or in an online laboratory for observing children's Elliot and accompanying digital literacy, so let me turn it over to them now, thank you i'm.

118
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.080
Eleonora Acerra: Trying to share my screen.

119
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.600
Eleonora Acerra: But they cannot.

120
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.140
Mark Marino: I think this up yeah and then you.

121
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.250

127
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:35.850
Nathalie Lacelle: It is a true pleasure for us to be here today and to share with you the lab behind website, which is also a laboratory of researches.

128
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.090
Nathalie Lacelle: which has just been launched for you.

129
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:51.810
Nathalie Lacelle: And results from a long research project realize between 2017 in 2020 in the framework of concerted actions between.

130
00:18:53.850 --> 00:19:07.410
Nathalie Lacelle: A fallen society and culture research founding and the culture and communication Ministry of Quebec so in five minutes presentation or seven but I took one.

131
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:14.430
Nathalie Lacelle: We would like to recall something lemons presented in our texts and maybe add some details.

132
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:29.880
Nathalie Lacelle: The first element, we want to stress is that we are presenting a work in progress, we are still integrating content and adjusting design features and functionality, so please do not hesitate to share your impressions reactions and improvement ideas.

133
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:39.090
Nathalie Lacelle: The second element, we want to stress concerns our team, in fact, even if today we can only you can only see the two of us.

134
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:46.320
Nathalie Lacelle: A team of teen researchers and teen research assistant from different disciplinary fields, education, literature and art.

135
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:55.830
Nathalie Lacelle: has been involved into research in different phases of our times, some of our colleagues gathered data among the publishers developers and.

136
00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:07.920
Nathalie Lacelle: Independent artists some others interview teachers some others worked together with our co creation partners and some of them are still working on different projects right now.

137
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.610
Nathalie Lacelle: we're certainly to talk to, because my bill.

138
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:26.760
Nathalie Lacelle: Another group that we are working with so after these premises, a few words about the history of this project, the aim of the project was to support digital publishing any such initiatives for young readers in Quebec.

139
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:37.860
Nathalie Lacelle: Through an observation of favorable production, distribution and reception practices, more particularly, we wanted to insert three main research questions that you can see right now.

140
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:58.710
Nathalie Lacelle: oriented, on the one side to publishers developers and artists willing to go digital and on the other, the educators, mainly teachers Librarians and families willing to offer new artistic and literary literary digital content content to young reader so it was a very big.

141
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:06.480
Nathalie Lacelle: field to look into So you can see our question research that.

142
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:16.410
Nathalie Lacelle: Are the origin of the project and our objective, so you can see, this into text, and right now in the.

143
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:29.550
Nathalie Lacelle: presentation, so we had some different ID identify document thing part co creating part and then we developed some.

144
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:38.190
Nathalie Lacelle: content that we will present right away so data was gathered vs semi structured interview with different.

145
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:47.640
Nathalie Lacelle: actors involving producing this routing or I kept our company the reception of children's digital literary works.

146
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:58.620
Nathalie Lacelle: And we mainly identifying three major issues i'm going really fast through the research hard, because I want to show you the the result.

147
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:13.650
Nathalie Lacelle: So the first one offers the lack of knowledge about the curate editorial offer by educators Librarians and, more generally, by common readers The second issue is related to young readers'.

148
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:22.110
Nathalie Lacelle: To facilities and pertains more particularly to school practices and to sequel cognitive and affective process involving.

149
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:35.490
Nathalie Lacelle: Digital reading which largely goes beyond pilot publishers and creators experience, expertise, the third difficulty emerges, and you can see all the ruptures points that we call that we could identify.

150
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:47.940
Nathalie Lacelle: In the first phase in which, after we could work through resolving those problem with through croak co creation, so the third difficulty images with the slight difference between teachers.

151
00:22:49.200 --> 00:23:03.480
Nathalie Lacelle: librarian Librarians and literally to mediators and offers in refers to like of guiding material materials to find in present digital creation, so I will it eleonora a present to the library lag behind.

152
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.120
Nathalie Lacelle: website and laboratory.

153
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:17.190
Eleonora Acerra: Hello everybody, so the labyrinth website has been created to reduce these issues and to support on one side, publishers.

154
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:29.250
Eleonora Acerra: In developing new content and on the other, educators and teachers in integrating them in their practice we developed it to the wordpress platform.

155
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:47.520
Eleonora Acerra: And we intended it as a virtual laboratory on the contemporary children's the digital literature and art and it is aimed at providing conceptual informative and did uptick resource based on based on scientific data.

156
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:59.460
Eleonora Acerra: So it has three main sections one for education tool, one for publishers and one concerning digital works.

157
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:10.740
Eleonora Acerra: At mission side are recording the first section of the of the website, we wanted to add readers teachers and publishers discovering.

158
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:21.510
Eleonora Acerra: The different forms that digital works can have we wanted to offer publishers and educator it's clear recommendations to overcome their issues.

159
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:41.190
Eleonora Acerra: We wanted to present your research projects carried out with our partners and, finally, we wanted to inform the public of any news related to children's eater events publications prizes new works so maybe we can just.

160
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.830
Eleonora Acerra: See the main.

161
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:54.810
Eleonora Acerra: pages, we have five sections, the first offers did they descriptions of the literature insurance, we have worked with.

162
00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:06.900
Eleonora Acerra: The second is for publishers and present this recommendations and advice based both on our research and on literature reviews.

163
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:18.210
Eleonora Acerra: The third contains descriptions of theoretical concepts on notions of digital literature that sin necessity to introduce teach the literature school.

164
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:32.700
Eleonora Acerra: and forth, as some projects follow during the research and the fifth complaints for sub sections and compiled relevant news on the Sunday Twitter.

165
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:47.880
Eleonora Acerra: you're there is a call for action for a new research that we are starting and that may interest, a lot of you, and you are already invited to participate.

166
00:25:48.780 --> 00:26:00.480
Eleonora Acerra: And we have selected some works, but to describe more in the day, but maybe we can do it later because we are on our eight minutes presentation.

167
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:09.180
Eleonora Acerra: Though maybe we can keep it for later and answer morning, the day on these are works.

168
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.630
Nathalie Lacelle: Okay, they don't know.

169
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.700
Nathalie Lacelle: If she can just put it there, then.

170
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.120
Nathalie Lacelle: it's an English, the the.

171
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.100
Nathalie Lacelle: Our new research, you can.

172
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.440
Eleonora Acerra: You can manage any English.

173
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.720
Nathalie Lacelle: And it's on your first.

174
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.370
Nathalie Lacelle: experiences and emotional experience of digital liberty.

175
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.960
Eleonora Acerra: yeah we are trying to gather your first.

176
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.410
Eleonora Acerra: Memories on the literature.

177
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.920
Mark Marino: Oh sounds great adults are allowed to answer those questions.

178
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.810
Mark Marino: yeah oh great.

179
00:26:45.930 --> 00:27:02.820
Mark Marino: Very good awesome well all right very good one i'm excited to hear more about to these to explore the site and learn about the individual works, because obviously i've got a long term project of trying to collect those works interesting works of digital electronic literature for children.

180
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:09.030
Mark Marino: yeah and now we're going to try to transition to our last speaker, last but not least.

181
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:20.190
Mark Marino: My collaborator and friend rob widow, who is going to present net profit in the classroom character building and team building.

182
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:27.090
Rob Wittig: Thank you Mayra quick great presentations it's so exciting the pieces coming together.

183
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:38.850
Rob Wittig: like this, so I am not gonna hide the gold i'm going to give you my two best tips for teaching net profit in the classroom, this is a undergrad university classroom right off the top.

184
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:50.850
Rob Wittig: Here they are the first one is called octopus hands it's an Anti carpal tunnel exercise now I always ask if this is offensive to anybody's culture and I need you to do it when you're just sitting there watching you need to do it.

185
00:27:51.420 --> 00:28:02.460
Rob Wittig: got a warm up writing, after all, is a physical activity, so your fingertips come together and you move them through the water you feel how good that feels on the front and back of those poor wrists it's the.

186
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:14.070
Rob Wittig: it's the occupational hazard of all writers so that's tip number one tip number two if you have one chance to move when you're at your desk writing it starts like this, you.

187
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:27.720
Rob Wittig: interlink your fingers like that straight up over your head oh my God, we all need that don't you need I can see it, you only need, and then you why go a little bit while i'll go i'll go i'll go do it in the classroom haven't stand up.

188
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.880
Rob Wittig: There you go excellent.

189
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.040
Rob Wittig: So can everybody see that okay.

190
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.070
Rob Wittig: Yes, okay um.

191
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.460
Rob Wittig: let's let's play.

192
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.730
Rob Wittig: Starting right up so one of the keys to net profit Internet improv.

193
00:28:51.510 --> 00:29:00.090
Rob Wittig: Is that the instructions are often less important than the model, so what I need everybody to do is read these three models, this is what I very often start out.

194
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:11.130
Rob Wittig: My students with read these three models and then write in the chat of this talk and I need everybody to write in the chat a similar post.

195
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.880
Rob Wittig: The three models you read the three models you'll get the idea.

196
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.290
Rob Wittig: Okay.

197
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:27.900
Rob Wittig: So read the three models and then just jump right into chat no right or wrong answers it's not a contest nobody's going to grade you.

198
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.510
Rob Wittig: But just jump in.

199
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:42.960
Rob Wittig: and start writing that next thing, so this series of models establishes what in theatre improv is often called the game.

200
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:55.590
Rob Wittig: Which is somebody will start a game that has to do with relationships, and this is obviously a game of kind of cooler than you or whatever you'd want to call that.

201
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.180
Rob Wittig: So go ahead i'm going to continue because we're we're.

202
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:11.520
Rob Wittig: On the tight time schedule, but just keep typing so everybody types at least one thing so just type of thing and it's interesting because um you know undergrad students love this this this cuts, a little bit closer to the bone for.

203
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.500
Rob Wittig: Early career and mid career academics these these three examples, but they're.

204
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:24.120
Rob Wittig: they're good example to start with, and this is, these are examples from a beautiful ancient website from 15 years ago.

205
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:33.990
Rob Wittig: or so called tweeting to heart, and that is the that's the game of that little writing exercise in a concept tweeting too hard so you're on Twitter and you're tweeting to heart.

206
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:44.430
Rob Wittig: So everybody who's on social media can kind of recognize that kind of game, so now, I want you to do a following thing I want you to look at your own post.

207
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:53.220
Rob Wittig: And sort of imagine who might have written it because, again i'm asking you to kind of do this exaggerated bragging.

208
00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:05.910
Rob Wittig: humble bragging is another name for what you are just doing so imagine that it's not you and that it's a character and give that character name and it can either be sort of a natural language human world's name.

209
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:22.470
Rob Wittig: Or, I invite you to write a social media handle for who that would be so just pause a second, who would have, who was the character, who wrote that those words that just came through your fingers, who is that so just write that down.

210
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.860
Rob Wittig: And now some of you, I think, are already can read the instructions.

211
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:35.760
Rob Wittig: are jumping ahead so once you've established that name I want you to repost what you just did you can copy and paste it right out of the chat.

212
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:46.830
Rob Wittig: repost what you just did but start with this name in whatever form, it is, and then a colon kind of like a script or a you know, a theatrical script or a movie script so start with the name.

213
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:52.470
Rob Wittig: If you want to like it's a you know, a natural language name, then put it in caps, you can.

214
00:31:52.710 --> 00:32:04.170
Rob Wittig: So just repost that for everybody, so that now there's not only the statement you wrote, but then there's the character and mark, can I ask because i'm as I tell my students i'm terrible at keeping track of chat just so good.

215
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:11.430
Rob Wittig: mark, let me know if there's anything in chat that I need to be known learn, you need to know about in this okay so really.

216
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.170
Mark Marino: Just followed their phone their rules.

217
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.260
Rob Wittig: Okay, is everybody repost it so now.

218
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:30.600
Rob Wittig: Using your character's name again you're going to start with your your character's name I want you to respond directly to some other characters post, not the person, but the characters posts.

219
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:38.010
Rob Wittig: and use the familiar social media form of address, which I love the at sign so so you put your name.

220
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.730
Rob Wittig: colon and then the at sign, so that we know who you're talking to, and then I want you to respond to that person.

221
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:52.230
Rob Wittig: And what you're going to see is that many of you even start to think about that this character relationship, how do these characters relate, and you know.

222
00:32:52.680 --> 00:33:12.090
Rob Wittig: What can you how can you in your first in your response to that other character begin to establish relationship or your colleagues are you professional competitors, is it a boss and employee situation where the power differential are they you know siblings or you know, is it.

223
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:28.260
Rob Wittig: Is one person, a narcissist and the other is feeding the other one their narcissistic supplies, one of my favorite psychological terms, so just go ahead and respond pick someone doesn't matter just random.

224
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:38.730
Rob Wittig: And again don't be worried if somebody didn't respond to yours it's not a judgment we're all just it's all just free play and i'm going to let you begin for the interest of time i'm going to charge ahead.

225
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:48.840
Rob Wittig: And while you're completing that because I think we're all multitasker so what I find in teaching creative writing keep using that practice each grade writing.

226
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:57.990
Rob Wittig: Is that I just throw students in the deep end just like I did with you all and that they love it that the students will thrive in the deep end so what is net profit.

227
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:08.940
Rob Wittig: it's Internet improv is one way of saying it, I guess, my current formula is networked and provides literature it's what people do it's when somebody cats.

228
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:18.000
Rob Wittig: Facebook account starts communicating with somebody else's cats Facebook account like that snap prop it happens all the time it's not something that we invented something that people do.

229
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:31.740
Rob Wittig: But the thing that mark and I and others are are sent are asking now is how good can you get at it, how you know how good an art form can this be and that's kind of a technical description of an improv.

230
00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:43.650
Rob Wittig: And it is not just a literary practice or an Internet practice it's also has a lot to do with games, what kind of a game is it it's not a competition scorekeeping game it's a.

231
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:56.460
Rob Wittig: game of memory can make believe so, what I find after I throw students in the deep end is that they need sort of a contextual support because I make an outrageous assertion when I show them about net profit, I say this is literature.

232
00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.330
Rob Wittig: And it's like what so I say, well, what do you know about literature like i'm going to show you some things you know we all know about.

233
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:15.690
Rob Wittig: You know the novel here's one of the earliest English novels life in a strange adventures Robinson Crusoe and you'll notice here on I always show this page, this is the original title page.

234
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:29.250
Rob Wittig: it's written by himself, and we know it was written by Daniel defoe it's considered a fictional novel but default died, claiming that Robinson Crusoe was written by Robinson Crusoe it was not a fiction.

235
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.330
Rob Wittig: Okay, so I can.

236
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.840
Rob Wittig: I can start up here mark do is that was that your timer.

237
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.850
Mark Marino: Sorry, that was my timer yeah.

238
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.540
Rob Wittig: Okay, so do you want, should I just charge the headers that should I just wrap up there.

239
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:49.260
Mark Marino: um well, we can bring things out I think in discussion is my suspicion.

240
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.820
Rob Wittig: that we can get to some other points.

241
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.220
Mark Marino: Probably the best idea.

242
00:35:54.870 --> 00:36:06.870
Mark Marino: But, or we can do, or first question could be what's one more thing you wish, you could have squeezed into your presentation that you'd like to add now do we do we want to do it sounds like that might be a good route let's do that.

243
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.270
Rob Wittig: let's let's let's do that with everybody yes okay.

244
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.680
Rob Wittig: It might have been a little tight.

245
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.140
Mark Marino: Okay sounds good so so let's give me i'm not gonna time is there a best best behavior.

246
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.700
Mark Marino: let's do one more thing you.

247
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:25.320
Mark Marino: wish you had time to to say, do we want to go in the same order reverse order, this time rob you just got done presenting do you want to go first on that.

248
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.680
Rob Wittig: yeah I might I might just do that so.

249
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.980
Mark Marino: Okay, so so rob's because he was do reverse order after rob.

250
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.590
Mark Marino: So start with rob.

251
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:45.390
Rob Wittig: OK, so the kinds of things I show them for context, are you know this moment where Robinson Crusoe is he insists that it's true and then.

252
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:54.630
Rob Wittig: Only 20 years later feeling has to insist that it's fake that he's not like these are not coded satires of real people, even though they have real sounding names.

253
00:36:55.290 --> 00:37:08.250
Rob Wittig: Samuel Johnson is forbidden by British law to do accounts of the British Parliament, so he does have an imaginary place that he just invented and everybody knows that he's talking about what happened in Parliament the day before.

254
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:16.650
Rob Wittig: A young middle school age kids Thomas chatterton pretends to find a cache of beautiful medieval documents.

255
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:30.480
Rob Wittig: turns out that he had written him himself really forged time he wrote them they're all really authentic he's in there's, this is an archive he shamed for that publicly commit suicide at age 17 becomes a kind of a cult figure of the.

256
00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:45.420
Rob Wittig: The romantic era Austrian of the imaginary Scottish bard also mock but then of course Tolkien does exactly the same thing, essentially, and then he's lionized later because that's because fiction.

257
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:56.340
Rob Wittig: is already up and establish so anyway, I just want to just teach people what that the origins of fiction look like this look like the enter the Internet world now.

258
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.640
Rob Wittig: I would give them contextual support from stage improv we haven't read the early PO.

259
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:16.710
Rob Wittig: As also as context and do practices in the one I would like little exercises and they build up to bigger projects, the one thing that I would just say that I would love to recommend everybody is in your own social media writing.

260
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:27.390
Rob Wittig: Use the hashtag secret diary and then write something that nobody you know you would never share with anybody like something's your innermost thoughts and you just hashtag its secret diary and.

261
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.490
Rob Wittig: This it's a thing i've seen it spread like wildfire among students among groups of friends.

262
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.380
Rob Wittig: like this hashtag it's just it's a convention, just like in theater.

263
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:47.850
Rob Wittig: We know that there are certain moments where this actor walks to the stage and talks directly to the audience and we all know that the other characters on stage can't hear them only the audience can hear that person.

264
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:52.830
Rob Wittig: So we're establishing those kinds of conventions in writing sorry I went on way too long sorry.

265
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:59.610
Mark Marino: No problem okay next up so Eleanor and natalie which one more thing you would you would like to add.

266
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.920
Nathalie Lacelle: Add on deanna, how do you want to share the the end of the so one or two digital.

267
00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.460
Nathalie Lacelle: literacy.

268
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.080
Eleonora Acerra: I need to unmute yes, maybe we can show.

269
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.750
Eleonora Acerra: Are you on my screen.

270
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:22.920
Yes.

271
00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:46.620
Eleonora Acerra: We can show some works, we have selected this one, and these are an adaptation of a print picture book and it's the story of this little boy fighting with this monsters that represent his cancer and it's not a sad story.

272
00:39:48.870 --> 00:40:07.620
Eleonora Acerra: But it's very engaging and for each record, we have described the team, the construction team and in detail the digital work and we had had did some reserves for teachers and educators.

273
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:19.440
Eleonora Acerra: If we add we add that we added some elements of experience that we did with children, this work is particularly.

274
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:34.200
Eleonora Acerra: Because it does our recreation platform inside so children can use never theological elements and rewrite their own story so it's quite interesting.

275
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:49.530
Eleonora Acerra: Another one that we like to show is to we like it, because he realized by our Member of our work research team in the framework other.

276
00:40:50.040 --> 00:41:06.600
Eleonora Acerra: Research some PhD research it's available in Spanish and in French, because the artist is Spanish, even if, even if she's bodies in Quebec and it's on narrative of.

277
00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:14.850
Eleonora Acerra: With several thoughts and there are six different endings according to the readers choices.

278
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.710
Eleonora Acerra: Well, I was thinking, the other day, when there was then.

279
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:43.620
Eleonora Acerra: exhibition we keep keep the exhibition that the issues that you observed in the possibility to access and discover works are even deeper for the French speaking countries because the production is mainly in English.

280
00:41:44.820 --> 00:42:04.890
Eleonora Acerra: So it is really important to have resources in French, to let publishers and teachers accept the content that's why the research and the website it's really true need for our communities.

281
00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.410
Eleonora Acerra: And we made the same choice you made for the exhibition.

282
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:25.080
Eleonora Acerra: sense that our website contains digital works more suitable for very young children and others than that can be using secondary schools or year we are long.

283
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.650
Eleonora Acerra: generative the digital work.

284
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:37.140
Eleonora Acerra: is certainly more difficult for young readers and we want to give it.

285
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.470
Eleonora Acerra: Different so that each.

286
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.580
Eleonora Acerra: Public me feel representing.

287
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.600
Eleonora Acerra: And I didn't know if you have.

288
00:42:48.690 --> 00:43:03.570
Nathalie Lacelle: A new we can we show every time we show where we can find we can find it because that's very hard in the Apps it's it's so hard to just try with the title to get to find the.

289
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:11.190
Nathalie Lacelle: The the literature so maybe just to finished in your House show where they can.

290
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:13.560
Nathalie Lacelle: They can do this for me.

291
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.000
Yes.

292
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.470
Eleonora Acerra: eat.

293
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:21.480
Eleonora Acerra: That in this section me calls to action.

294
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.430
Mark Marino: you're going to share that in the chat too, and I can also share that through elo, by the way, I can say.

295
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.940
Oh.

296
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:29.460
Nathalie Lacelle: Mark we.

297
00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.900
Nathalie Lacelle: We wanted to ask you.

298
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.710
Mark Marino: yeah no problem.

299
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.260
Mark Marino: People will people will be very happy to fill that out.

300
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.260
Nathalie Lacelle: Okay, so we share in the chat now great.

301
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.020
Mark Marino: Alright, well, thank you so much, and then then Elliot if you add one more thing that you could add what would you add.

302
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.370
Elliott Hedman: All you guys have told me what I should add, so I will do what the chat have asked me.

303
00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.410
Mark Marino: Okay, very good, so the question good.

304
00:43:53.100 --> 00:44:03.420
Elliott Hedman: So i'm just going to share my screen to teach you i'm so we have over 100 books, I mean this is all on my free time so it's not like I have put them all up yet.

305
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:14.370
Elliott Hedman: But and we've read over 60 at the boys and girls club this year and we just keep changing them each time, so you guys are asking like what kind of books, we started out with about 15 minute novels.

306
00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:25.560
Elliott Hedman: All of them need to have cartoons in them, and so we have ones about bubble gum getting stuck in the hair or a vampire that's trying to make kids laugh because.

307
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:37.350
Elliott Hedman: Laughter But then what I found out was that kids actually prefer much shorter stories because they really have about an attention span of about five minutes, so you won't see most of even the APP store today but.

308
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.380
Elliott Hedman: This one is about helping the headless horseman find his head and it's only a five minutes story.

309
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:53.850
Elliott Hedman: And we have a whole bunch of those the ones that kids really like are the different ones about different cultures, like, why is there a Turkey drying and an aztec temple and it ends up turkeys were gods or.

310
00:44:54.120 --> 00:45:02.970
Elliott Hedman: Why are people in Spain jumping over babies and that's a form of baptism to get rid of devils those ones really resonate and the ones that are really resonating right now with kids are.

311
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.730
Elliott Hedman: There versus story for its.

312
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:15.720
Elliott Hedman: And vs stink bug and we grow them giant they go fight each other, and we have to learn about different kinds of things about them, I think the last one we had was like.

313
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:24.090
Elliott Hedman: Venus Flytrap vs butterfly you learn all those things about the animals that they're fighting and you're like trying to guess who's going to win and how do you help them win the process so.

314
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:36.300
Elliott Hedman: we've really a collaborative effort to come up with those stories and that's where it's going very short stories in a question about every 30 seconds, the other question for me was how do I measure.

315
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:43.560
Elliott Hedman: emotion emotions let's see if I can pull that up real fast duty duty to.

316
00:45:47.970 --> 00:46:02.130
Elliott Hedman: Here I am at MIT measuring emotions, this is my sensor and what we're measuring is your skin conductance and that's your that's how much you're sweating and why do we care how much you're sweating that's your fight or flight response and.

317
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.330
Mark Marino: Elliot it's not.

318
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.370
Mark Marino: it's not sharing, I think the screen.

319
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:06.930
Elliott Hedman: share.

320
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.680
Mark Marino: Think ensuring.

321
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:12.300
Elliott Hedman: Thank you, I appreciate that okay there's a cool sensor well.

322
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:23.160
Elliott Hedman: This we put these little sensors on your finger and they measure how open your sweat glands are and your sweat glands are tied to your sympathetic nervous system, so when you get excited or anxious.

323
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:31.770
Elliott Hedman: you'll see little micro changes in that think of when your heart starts beating your eyes dilate you get those changes all the time, so we're actually measuring that subconscious emotional reaction.

324
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:39.390
Elliott Hedman: that's actually what drew me into books, to begin with i've done consulting and all sorts of different spaces, but I just found that reading was really missing the.

325
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:50.040
Elliott Hedman: children's rereading was really missing those emotional engagements that a lot of other media they had was helping with so that's the tool I use.

326
00:46:51.660 --> 00:47:00.900
Mark Marino: Okay that's fantastic Oh, my goodness, I love all these projects too much all right next up this team skunk kale if you could add one more thing about your.

327
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:08.430
Mark Marino: it's probably a bad way to refer to you guys, but if you could add one more thing your project, and this can be rachel's moment to just say whatever she wants to.

328
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:14.730
Rachel Horst: Okay yeah I will just share my screen and just just make a connection.

329
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:24.090
Rachel Horst: With the story and the storing methodology back to our our pedagogy and our to teaching so we've used this tool.

330
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:46.590
Rachel Horst: This prompt and others like it to engage graduate students teacher education students with different practices of reading, writing engagement so so this I think kendrick explain this tool, taking the text and D D pulling out the linearity of it, but still retaining some of the.

331
00:47:47.610 --> 00:48:04.290
Rachel Horst: The generative qualities of the text and allowing readers and writers, to engage with it and participate in that in that kind of narrative space so it's been a really this is part of other workshops that we've done exploring this kind of.

332
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.380
Rachel Horst: Creative deeply creative engagement with with text so yeah.

333
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:18.420
Mark Marino: Okay that's fantastic all right well let's go to I don't know what are we on speaker view or something like that do I have control over this, let me.

334
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.840
Mark Marino: i'm gonna try switch to gallery view so I can kind of look at each other.

335
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:38.790
Mark Marino: And then i'm just going to go through the chat and just see if there any other questions that we haven't picked up and then you guys can queue up for other ones, by raising your hand icon or typing other ones various comments Lola and there's some net profit happens.

336
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.500
Mark Marino: chef boyardee isn't here, so I don't think there's a question.

337
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.220
Mark Marino: Okay here's here's a question from Sarah you have a question says, you want to ask your question live.

338
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.210
Serge BOUCHARDON: Listen to it, you know I met the entity which one.

339
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.210
Mark Marino: Are you have two questions in here as.

340
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.790
Serge BOUCHARDON: You have a question, maybe.

341
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:14.970
Serge BOUCHARDON: We bought question for everyone, and maybe, especially for Napoleon.

342
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:22.050
Serge BOUCHARDON: How to educate in digital literacy so data literature.

343
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.290
Serge BOUCHARDON: You have you've got two minutes.

344
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.540
Mark Marino: So, can you repeat it one more time for me, Sir, so I get the gist of it sorry.

345
00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.650
Serge BOUCHARDON: Sorry, so my question is how to educate in digital literacy.

346
00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.530
Serge BOUCHARDON: Through digital literature.

347
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.650
Serge BOUCHARDON: In, especially through to it.

348
00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:45.930
Serge BOUCHARDON: and

349
00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:58.050
Serge BOUCHARDON: Then I wrote can can we push to that that teachings a delicate maximally activates your operations involved in any detail reading.

350
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.320
Mark Marino: Okay.

351
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.550
Nathalie Lacelle: Now to take it.

352
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:11.250
Nathalie Lacelle: isn't this a project that we have and should take few years we just wrote a project about that, and you want us to answer that now.

353
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:24.540
Nathalie Lacelle: Well, we postulated that yes, because we think that kids should explore more and more forms of digital stories, so they can be exposed to different.

354
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:38.970
Nathalie Lacelle: narratives that non linear nonlinear narrative narrative so they can represent that narratives can be nonlinear in many ways, so I think the first project is a good.

355
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:54.180
Nathalie Lacelle: A very good example, so I think it's a it's not it's we don't we don't think it in a explicit strategy to equate of teaching a.

356
00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:06.510
Nathalie Lacelle: Multi multi, for example, component and then and exploring it and doing it systematically we just want to go.

357
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:23.880
Nathalie Lacelle: be able to explore many different digital stories on different digital devices and being exposed we postulate that you can anticipate.

358
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:46.380
Nathalie Lacelle: The movements and the interaction than the navigation and the possibilities of the different narratives that you are you encounter so maybe I can say more, but I think it represents what what we think right now, maybe with more applied research with.

359
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.020
Nathalie Lacelle: Some data as.

360
00:51:50.130 --> 00:52:04.440
Nathalie Lacelle: proving it, we can we can show other ways and maybe alien or hiking complete, but after I have since I answered I can ask the question so maybe we can go like that mark like kids do.

361
00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:05.910
Nathalie Lacelle: We.

362
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.000
Mark Marino: We can but before we do that, let me honor I should.

363
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:10.680
Nathalie Lacelle: have questions in the chat.

364
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:15.900
Mark Marino: Okay okay sorry there's a second question from from dina dina do you want to ask your question live.

365
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.480
What you want to see.

366
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:37.260
Mark Marino: I don't know I don't hear dina, so I will read her question so dina asked the question, how do you teach the rhetoric of he lit.

367
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:49.230
Mark Marino: How links work how images and text synchronize for meaning, etc, so I guess this This seems in some ways, like an extension of surges question but it's going even further.

368
00:52:50.220 --> 00:53:05.940
Eleonora Acerra: A maybe I can start answering it depends on the public when we what we we work in the education field, so we work with future teachers.

369
00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:18.030
Eleonora Acerra: When we work with future teachers at primary school it's quite easy in a certain way, because we have the print book examples and we start.

370
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:34.350
Eleonora Acerra: Building meaning with interaction between text and images and then we complex SCI fi we show examples of digital works and we try to be together with.

371
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:48.780
Eleonora Acerra: Students the poetics the static and the rhetorical effects of digital works and we tried to do the same thing with secondary school teachers.

372
00:53:49.860 --> 00:54:04.410
Eleonora Acerra: We use also non leader you works, I think some SMS work on media on newspapers, so we tried to to show.

373
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:07.230
Eleonora Acerra: Two examples.

374
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.770
Eleonora Acerra: What are the with CBD.

375
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:16.560
Deena Larsen: That makes a lot of sense, and thank you i'm sorry for my technical difficulties.

376
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:26.580
Deena Larsen: I was really fascinated by the wonder stories and the point with digital literature is that we can do the connections, we, which is much more than we can do in print.

377
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:45.450
Deena Larsen: And I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the advantages of the electronic literature, the idea that we can make connections like cause effect next after and really start teaching these types of thinking skills and that would help so.

378
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.280
Elliott Hedman: You know you're speaking to my heart, thank you.

379
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.640
Elliott Hedman: I want to start moving interesting story on that the kind of answer your question and i'll answer your question but um.

380
00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:03.750
Elliott Hedman: So when I originally incorporated wonder stories there's a there's choose your own adventures in there, so you can.

381
00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:12.720
Elliott Hedman: Okay, how are we going to sneak past mom and dad there's one where you had to figure out where mom went and you actually investigated the car and you chose what to look out around the car when you did that.

382
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:21.600
Elliott Hedman: Interestingly enough, when I i'm a i'm a designer he said I go in I watch kids review things that are polite tracking glasses on them I watch what happens and.

383
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:24.510
Elliott Hedman: Those choose your own adventures didn't work very well.

384
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:35.640
Elliott Hedman: kids were treating them like problems like things to be solved, instead of things to explore, so they always thought there was a correct answer they're like Oh, I know the right way is i'm going to do it this way i'm like.

385
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:43.950
Elliott Hedman: There wasn't but you the kids really like this, like almost black and white world of like I want to get this thing right, I want to prove to you i'm smart.

386
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:51.870
Elliott Hedman: And you know that's what I capitalize on most of my APP is all about meeting those kids where they're at so i'm you know still an open space explorer.

387
00:55:52.110 --> 00:56:02.760
Elliott Hedman: Choose your own adventure still is open, but it didn't create what I was looking for, like the sense of wanting to see everything and that explosion, it was much more about them getting to cognitive Problem Solving so.

388
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:12.900
Elliott Hedman: That leads to your bigger question is like what if about it, so I just gave a talk where they're like what's the difference between digital and physical and, like everything will be digital in the future and it comes down to comprehension.

389
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:21.870
Elliott Hedman: abilities and you were talking about that with that coddle thing um I actually have a real real problem because i'm not I don't have a writing background you guys are all so much smarter than I am.

390
00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:28.290
Elliott Hedman: i'm just a humble researcher, but what I what I discovered here was.

391
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:44.580
Elliott Hedman: That writers don't write for inference so like I would ask writers to write for wonder series and and say Johnny came into the House with a red coat question one what color was the code i'm like, no, no, no one wants to answer that question.

392
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:49.440
Elliott Hedman: And so I had to go back and i'm like no you gotta say Johnny comes in he's wearing a Cape and a math.

393
00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:56.040
Elliott Hedman: What costume is just like who does john you think he is he's a superior that influence is actually a really high level of comprehension.

394
00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:07.380
Elliott Hedman: And kids are good at it like they think that kids can only do it at their grade know I have kindergarten cheering and all day long it's just they're never challenged with it they've never given these opportunities to apply for answers now here really awesome parent.

395
00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:13.620
Elliott Hedman: You can actually create moments of influence, you can talk to them like what do you think's going to happen next, what do you think's going to happen, it can happen, but.

396
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:20.400
Elliott Hedman: writers don't do that we almost always just tell people things, and so I feel like whenever I hire writers it's like.

397
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:26.610
Elliott Hedman: All right, get ready for a whole spiel of things that i've barely understand myself but i'm going to ask you to do things differently so.

398
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:34.080
Elliott Hedman: there's a lot of opportunity there where we put the reader in the driver's seat and even a mystery novel never puts a driver and the driver seat.

399
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:40.530
Elliott Hedman: Because, as soon as a person figured out the mystery and boring, you only figure it out on the last page there's a whole new art fair about this space.

400
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:53.940
Deena Larsen: That makes a lot of sense and yet with with the folks that are just saying question answer Question answer and you got the complexity, one of the things that I think mark and rob do this as well, you can.

401
00:57:54.690 --> 00:58:16.320
Deena Larsen: Do a writers workshop where you get just pieces of paper different ribbons yarn whatever and show the different types of connections um you can show how things work, and I think you're doing such a wonderful job of teaching the kids to think let's think these things through damn it.

402
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:20.880
Deena Larsen: yeah and hypertext any electronic literature can do that so absolutely Thank you.

403
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:24.630
Elliott Hedman: Absolutely that's what the kids want to what you guys are out.

404
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.450
Elliott Hedman: Everyone wants it it's just not.

405
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.100
Deena Larsen: I.

406
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:34.980
Mark Marino: agree 100% now now i'm going to pull a question from Andrew because he's asking question later on the chat.

407
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:40.020
Mark Marino: For Scott tales we haven't heard from those guys in a while Andrew do you want to say your question discount tales.

408
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.260
Andrew Klobucar: Well, I think.

409
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:49.620
Mark Marino: Oh it's for the other people what they think of skunk tales that's right that's right, so I just I wanted to get the we have.

410
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.200
Andrew Klobucar: Two different really interesting methodologies here can can they may be talk about each other's.

411
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.270
Mark Marino: Okay, what did they think of each other's.

412
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.400
Mark Marino: Projects okay fair enough good.

413
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:07.830
Mark Marino: Have that what do you all think of each other's or wait what maybe a better way to frame that that might be more productive for every girl on the table.

414
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:16.410
Mark Marino: What are you taking away like where do you see either lines of connection or something you're taking away from another panelists project who how about that one.

415
00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.530
Mark Marino: Who wants to go first just jump in.

416
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:28.440
Rachel Horst: Well, I was just typing some thoughts around I love your work.

417
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:43.050
Rachel Horst: Elliot and i'm thinking about my son and and and his difficulties with reading and how he he, like that's the problem solving and that kind of immediate sort of what is it in getting the answer and that kind of.

418
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:57.030
Rachel Horst: engagement, but I also worry or wonder about total digital the total digital thing, and some of the work that we've been doing in the digital literacy Center is around making.

419
00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:13.770
Rachel Horst: The analog and the digital experiences so that they move together, and not forgetting the embodied and that tactile and paper, but also the digital, and so I wonder if you can have if you have thoughts about that.

420
01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:20.880
Elliott Hedman: Well i'm really excited about your thoughts on that Rachel i'm spoiler yellow 2022 i'm.

421
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:32.850
Elliott Hedman: On the last part of a grant for a full year i'm looking at what you just said, which is what happens when we take wonder stories and put it into physical world, so what happens if we build a claim model, while we're reading.

422
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:43.530
Elliott Hedman: or just things are we're like interacting and cognitively thinking about the story, while we're doing it, but i'm curious what you said, I am very I have no idea what i'm doing don't tell that to the people.

423
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.940
Elliott Hedman: Rachel, what do you think about that multimedia perspective.

424
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:53.280
Rachel Horst: I love the idea of sculpting and that while while.

425
01:00:54.570 --> 01:01:02.250
Rachel Horst: While engaging with the text we've done things like you know we taking a picture and uploading it.

426
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:18.510
Rachel Horst: Or you know something from your environment or going somewhere or you know you having to read I you know underneath a doorway or something like some ways of I don't I don't know but, like, I think that that could bring it out of the total cerebral just.

427
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:19.830
Rachel Horst: You know.

428
01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.520
Rachel Horst: Touching but touching touching buttons.

429
01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.760
Rachel Horst: i'm sure people have lots of thoughts on this.

430
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.950
Mark Marino: All right now, what else, are you learning from each other's projects are your takeaways.

431
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:43.740
Elliott Hedman: I i'll i'll go next is i've really appreciated labyrinths thing, because here I am with my little digital tool and i'm like.

432
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:48.270
Elliott Hedman: Oh man I didn't realize that there's this whole marketing thing I have to do and.

433
01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:58.230
Elliott Hedman: Just this idea that i'm not alone it's just so nice it's like oh you mean that there's like a lot of people out there who are trying to make a difference and I and there's people out there, trying to like.

434
01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:08.910
Elliott Hedman: solve some of these really big challenges is that at the end of the day, people aren't really thing books as digital mediums So how do you communicate that and it's kind of cool to see that favor cultural front and come back all these.

435
01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:19.080
Elliott Hedman: cool stuff around education i'm always impressed, but I really I really appreciate during my favorite resource and people who are trying to do something on a space that's that's very empowering on my end.

436
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.040
Mark Marino: Nice who wants to go next rob you want to go next.

437
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.850
Rob Wittig: yeah I just I absolutely love the skunk tales project and many things about it but and.

438
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:45.720
Rob Wittig: One of them was I loved the kind of origin story of how you know it starts with writing in person and that which is just this incredibly fun thing to do, and that, based on that, then this transition to zoom and and you know far away.

439
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.170
Rob Wittig: Collaboration distance collaboration kind of.

440
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:58.620
Rob Wittig: works and because that's you know it's sort of my own story of hanging out with invisible Seattle writing on one of the very early Bulletin boards and then moving having to move away.

441
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:03.300
Rob Wittig: Missing my friends and using the Bulletin board, given the high cost of.

442
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:11.730
Rob Wittig: of long distance phones at that time, like using the Bulletin board to stay in touch with my friends and keep doing these writing experiments that we had started.

443
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:27.990
Rob Wittig: And then I just totally love this idea of having another kind of sensory neurosis circuit system, the sounds as this thing to bounce the story off as a companion and and.

444
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:39.240
Rob Wittig: You know antagonist and and collaborator and so on having that sound as this theme that goes, all the way through I just think that's super smart it's got me thinking about ways of doing kind of.

445
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:48.120
Rob Wittig: dual track projects that are writing and then wind around other other media, so I think there's just lots to be inspired by their.

446
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:51.660
Mark Marino: Nice nice it's gone.

447
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.050
Mark Marino: tales.

448
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.710
What do you got.

449
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.250
Kedrick James: I just want to say that in some of those processes Rachel was describing.

450
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:08.100
Kedrick James: i'll give a little shout out to Andrew that we've been incorporating the language workbench gto language workbench which he and Dave air.

451
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:16.260
Kedrick James: built in almost all of it it's really central part in fact it's very central part of our pedagogy.

452
01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:30.030
Kedrick James: And what it opens up is this ability of a text to morph according to you know parameters you set, and I see so many connections with these other works, you know Elliot you're using these wonderful.

453
01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:42.570
Kedrick James: bits of technology to read you know galvanic skin response and what have you and it just opens up because you know i've done some experiments with galvanic skin response running Mitty.

454
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:49.170
Kedrick James: So that it's converted into Midi code and of course that's how singling words to it takes text and turns it into many code.

455
01:04:49.590 --> 01:05:02.070
Kedrick James: And so there's these way is that you know I could see combining where a student starts to get bored if he's on that downward curve after the end spike there in the attention he's on the downward curve.

456
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:10.920
Kedrick James: And i'm thinking you know, like it just hits a threshold that triggers a question or it changes the narrative it reverses you know.

457
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:21.600
Kedrick James: Andrew when you know what can we do here, we could change the adjectives and make it dark and scary instead of you know, positive light and happy, you know, because some kids like that better.

458
01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.010
Elliott Hedman: So.

459
01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:33.120
Kedrick James: I just liked the idea that texts are in fact generative the reader is not reading something set in stone and digital literature makes that so much more possible.

460
01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:44.760
Kedrick James: You know you're talking about adventure stories and how you're choosing, and is there a right answer and somehow the generativity that is possible, especially when we enter some of these happy even analog.

461
01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:52.800
Kedrick James: interactive processes, it could just you know live in for for the board kid or whatever yeah.

462
01:05:53.280 --> 01:06:05.220
Elliott Hedman: I really liked the idea of reactive like i've never heard that before it's it's not just like follow a path, but we're going to respond to where you're at well not just you just choose your path.

463
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:12.480
Elliott Hedman: And that's really interesting i've seen it in media they're they're really crazy style but i've never thought about that I like that push.

464
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:14.850
Mark Marino: Nice yeah and you yeah.

465
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:26.310
Yuya Peco Takeda: yeah Thank you and just kind of related but i'm i'm i'm i'm thinking a lot about what you said earlier earlier.

466
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:36.360
Yuya Peco Takeda: That put putting readers on the driver's seat, and this kind of making inferences from what you're reading and sorry i'm kind of.

467
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:44.220
Yuya Peco Takeda: i'm taking a driver's seat and what you're saying, but I study conspiracy theories and I was just thinking you know.

468
01:06:44.820 --> 01:07:07.290
Yuya Peco Takeda: Those who are really good at inferring making inference from what they're reading are conspiracy theorists excellent par excellence of making inferences so I was wondering, you know this kind of I think I mean I know the author's dad but isn't it kind of dis making.

469
01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:22.740
Yuya Peco Takeda: I wonder about the importance of mock up taking the driver seat, but, listening to what the author is saying and be patient about it, so I wonder if this kind of.

470
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:29.910
Yuya Peco Takeda: If your project can facilitate that kind of patients as well that you know.

471
01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:43.530
Yuya Peco Takeda: paying attention to the intentionality of the author I I it's I did come up i'm saying it with the coach on you know intentionality and so on, but.

472
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.930
Yuya Peco Takeda: I was wondering about it.

473
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:54.330
Elliott Hedman: really like very question you're also what kind of conference where can we have a conversation about that, I just want to give a shout out for like wow OK i've never.

474
01:07:54.630 --> 01:08:05.760
Elliott Hedman: thought about the consequences of conspiracy theorists I wonder stories before um i'll give you a fun story on this one I don't have an answer and I think you're bringing up actually a bigger question and i'll bring that up.

475
01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:15.240
Elliott Hedman: So I wrote a story about a fish and the fish escape the aquarium and ended up, it was in the bathtub and it was wearing a costume.

476
01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:24.390
Elliott Hedman: The girl stole the fish and put a costume on it and put it in the bath tub and the kids were pissed off of that because I asked a question I was like.

477
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:31.020
Elliott Hedman: Why was it the fish in the bathroom and it was like cuz she worked costume and the kids like fishes can't wear costumes.

478
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.630
Elliott Hedman: Like they were all just like letting me know that that question was incorrect and that we did the we did the story wrong.

479
01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:48.750
Elliott Hedman: And I thought this was really interesting because you know no you read it wrong it wasn't that the fish can do costumes you didn't get the right thing, but kids it was so disappointing like if I kept doing that, with them.

480
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:55.560
Elliott Hedman: I would not be meeting them where they're at so it's a lot of me meeting them where they're at and helping them there because I remember my.

481
01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:03.120
Elliott Hedman: Only goal, I, like the trifles the reading is like where the training was like make sure that they feel like they're smart and they got it going.

482
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:14.010
Elliott Hedman: And that gets to the next question you have, which is there are other things I wonder stories with non teachings the number one thing is just being able to read, for a long period of time, I think another one is to.

483
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:24.900
Elliott Hedman: discover ideas that you disagree with, and to be able to be okay with that I think that's what you're talking about I think there's some really am and I work with high school is in a while, where they need to work on the things to.

484
01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:35.040
Elliott Hedman: I think there's a lot of skills that we don't really think about the wonder story is just kind of bad because I need to meet the kids where they're at, and I am worried about that, in part, that I think.

485
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:43.800
Elliott Hedman: I wouldn't want wonder sorry to replace all the teacher, I just want to, I want to get it so kids can read offense and not say oh if you're going to take forever I give up and that's where i'm at.

486
01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:51.630
Mark Marino: All right, very good JEREMY do we get to the question you were gonna ask all right go ahead when you pose it.

487
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.840
Then.

488
01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:54.840
Mark Marino: you're muted.

489
01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:08.190
Jeremy Hight: I hope it makes sense at all, I came in super late, I apologize, my friends were presenting at siggraph and I almost think they should jump into the yellow my friend pastor donny.

490
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:25.080
Jeremy Hight: At has made a book and it's in it's a cookbook and it looks really 70s, but it's about food and rot and decay and it's actually a feminist commentary I think she said pop on over and then my friend, Joe Davis at MIT is looking at.

491
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.050
Jeremy Hight: it's like ancient Arabic.

492
01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:39.030
Jeremy Hight: Art iconography and in DNA and biology and I heard MIT mentioned, I saw the sensor thing, and my ears kind of popped up.

493
01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:51.330
Jeremy Hight: And I came in late, so I don't know if i'm coming out of left field but I used to be an editor for Leah and now i'm a reviewer for Leonardo, and I would love to hear more about the connective area.

494
01:10:51.900 --> 01:11:04.380
Jeremy Hight: between research and haptics and senses and biofeedback not by Felix 70s, but like body reactivity and narrative ology I know it's been kind of talked about but that's fascinating to me.

495
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:20.460
Elliott Hedman: Really chat with you more I also the yellow article goes into it and create details and then also here's a link that will describe it more I don't want to repeat myself, but yeah I could talk to literally all day.

496
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.590
Jeremy Hight: Okay.

497
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.720
Mark Marino: um rob has a question.

498
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:42.810
Rob Wittig: I just I have just a little footnote to that that haptics because I also was really loving that that kind of haptics body, the you know sensory thing dimensions of these projects, but just want to recommend to people if you don't know if there's a wonderful little George Perez.

499
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:48.120
Rob Wittig: it's called a sketch for an essay and it's and he's.

500
01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:52.920
Rob Wittig: He basically says, this should be a proper study of reading as a physical activity.

501
01:11:53.400 --> 01:12:00.030
Rob Wittig: For example, what's the difference between reading on your stomach and reading on your back reading on your side reading sitting down and.

502
01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:07.710
Rob Wittig: he's you know he knows it's it's these are funny ideas but he's being really serious and the the part of that that I love that I think just really that.

503
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:20.520
Rob Wittig: That I would love to see that kind of study that JEREMY was pointing towards and you folks doing, he says a CAFE I used to go to I used to say, a famous philosopher would always come along and he would bring a book and he would.

504
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:32.370
Rob Wittig: Read while he was eating and perfect says, you know I would observe him a bite, a concept, a bite, a concept, what is the result of this double nourishment.

505
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:43.110
Rob Wittig: Well it's like and that's a super important question and I just don't think I think there's a serious area of research that that points towards that i'd love to see people follow up on.

506
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.430
Rob Wittig: I love it.

507
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.870
Mark Marino: I love it what it what a great quote.

508
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:53.130
Mark Marino: My goodness as awesome let me save her that for a while and well i'm savoring and i'm going to turn things over to Maria men see who's had a hand up for a while to.

509
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.780
Maria Mencia: Sorry, no, I was trying to.

510
01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:05.040
Maria Mencia: discuss what what area was talking about before as well with the fish, I want to go back to the fish.

511
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:07.710
Mark Marino: back to the fish in the costume okay.

512
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.910
Elliott Hedman: i'm sorry.

513
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:20.640
Maria Mencia: Nice because m well I haven't been teaching nearly two children, but I used to teach art and.

514
01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:31.230
Maria Mencia: It was amazing because already depending of the ages, I mean once I think once they are over six they already have this kind of them.

515
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.390
Maria Mencia: You know they are, they have this convention already have what things are you know.

516
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:45.330
Maria Mencia: If you're actually dealing with children that are before six year old or something they're still seem to be like really free they don't have any conventions yet or anything.

517
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:54.210
Maria Mencia: But I just wanted to mention, because I was is they wants to do a drawing of their fellow you know they are friends.

518
01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:11.070
Maria Mencia: Are face, you know doing of their face, and I said you can't see their face, yes, you have to touch it so practically they have to touch the face of the person and draw you know these portrayed and and you know they some of them were incapable.

519
01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:24.600
Maria Mencia: They were live is you know, like trying to see a little bit and trying to actually do a portrayed in the way that a Portuguese supposed to be instead of doing a portrait that was based on the feeling of.

520
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:35.340
Maria Mencia: That phase, you know and create something different, and so I was just wondering, you know, in terms of teaching also elite.

521
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:47.070
Maria Mencia: You know those kind of conventions, you know that children already layer, and you know when the beginning other now if anybody wants to comment on that maybe I don't know area.

522
01:14:51.270 --> 01:15:11.220
Eleonora Acerra: is true for me it's when all the most wonderful thing when we work with children, to see how they are surprised, and now they try to manipulate the screen and the narrative for it, for me, the most rewarding moment of my.

523
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:28.440
Eleonora Acerra: Research life and and I was thinking always transfer to dinner, of course, we try to work on interpretation jester, especially with mobile Apps and mobile Apps are.

524
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:40.440
Eleonora Acerra: strongly integrated integrated to the narrative and children have to interpret their gestures, the meaning of the gestures to understand the story.

525
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:50.250
Eleonora Acerra: So he would try to work in all the sense i'm really interested in how they manipulate and now the hands.

526
01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:56.250
Eleonora Acerra: translate their interpretation toy, we are trying to be.

527
01:15:57.450 --> 01:16:12.210
Eleonora Acerra: All this knowledge we don't do it with eye trackers so we just try to gather their statements and to study all they understand and interpret.

528
01:16:13.410 --> 01:16:34.200
Eleonora Acerra: The narrative narratives and their gestures and when they try to recall it and to see what they needed what at what they have seen why they are surprised, why it's non linear what possibilities they should have had the in another context.

529
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:35.850
Eleonora Acerra: well.

530
01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:44.190
Mark Marino: Something is occurring to me here and really like i'm just loving this panel and it's it's i'm doing everything I can not to like.

531
01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:54.780
Mark Marino: interrupt this discussion with a million thoughts, but I do want to share something i've noticed across all the panelists that the word that keeps coming up across all four presentations is engagement.

532
01:16:55.230 --> 01:17:05.670
Mark Marino: And what's fascinating to me is that I think there is a mythological presumption that the experience of reading is abstracted from bodies.

533
01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:09.390
Mark Marino: And that it happens in the mind over a sustained period of time this is.

534
01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:18.360
Mark Marino: Deep attention to details right it's about right and it has someone sitting physically still and we don't even care about what's happening to their body, because only happening between.

535
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:25.650
Mark Marino: their eyes and the text and no reaction know processing whatever it's just there they're letting the text do what it's going to do, inevitably.

536
01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:36.240
Mark Marino: And what I love about all of these works, whether we're talking about reading or we're talking about writing or we're talking about text that turns into speech or speech or texts that turns into motion.

537
01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:48.570
Mark Marino: or motion that turns back into play, and the play turns back into text right is that I think it, you know, in some ways, maybe even this whole yellow conference should be called the Multi sensory.

538
01:17:49.800 --> 01:18:02.490
Mark Marino: Symbolic encounter conference right because there's something that we deeply understand and and teachers know it third for kindergarten teachers know it, they don't they don't handle a book.

539
01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:15.570
Mark Marino: it's a here just sit in that little corner, they read it out loud and they draw and they point fingers at that you know, like all of those things right in same one we're telling stories to children right.

540
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.540
Mark Marino: You don't sit there and say hey children sit there on the rug and i'm going to tell you a story first four hours.

541
01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:28.440
Mark Marino: right they interrupt you, and they squirm and they move their bodies or I don't know just all of this is really just got me thinking.

542
01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:42.600
Mark Marino: In so many different ways and again it's it's that you all seem to have some sense that there is this heightened level of engagement that we can bring to these creative or you know, create a reading creative writing processes.

543
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:44.100
And that we've got a.

544
01:18:45.360 --> 01:19:00.390
Mark Marino: We can tap into that somehow maybe with the interface on some level or with some really well some creatively used instructions in the case of of rob and skunk tails I think perhaps anyway somebody want to jump in on that one.

545
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.100
Mark Marino: And I know we're at time we're just like we're at the very end.

546
01:19:11.010 --> 01:19:20.610
Elliott Hedman: I really resonates with me it's really what I believe and i'm careful of the word engagement, because it means many things, but it's about participation and attention for me.

547
01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:25.470
Elliott Hedman: But just to give you an example adults have this problem to one of my first projects was.

548
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:34.440
Elliott Hedman: Working on classical music, you know most adults really get bored listening to classical music send them to a concert if they've never been before this is what it looks like going to a classical concert.

549
01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:45.390
Elliott Hedman: This is an expert going to a classical concert and it just ends up being the case, that everything we do when it's novel and it's hard we need extra help to pay attention and to stay focused and be stimulated.

550
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:52.170
Elliott Hedman: And we think that kids are bad or their their troublemakers for wanting, and I know that's actually the nature of human emotions.

551
01:19:52.500 --> 01:20:01.920
Elliott Hedman: And so we can make literature to meet people where they're at and we've never had the opportunity, since now to do that and it's fighting norms and being creative and trying new things that's really exciting.

552
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:16.590
Mark Marino: I love it, and again I love that that that rob brings that insight back to the zoom experience with the students because we've done we've done it again haven't we rob.

553
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:24.480
Mark Marino: we've done that we've just done it with a new medium well, of course, people like to sit in front of cameras for prolonged periods of times right.

554
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.310
Mark Marino: Why, of course, sure they do yeah.

555
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:34.380
Mark Marino: All right, well we're kind of time any last comments.

556
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:44.700
Nathalie Lacelle: Well, just the last comments and I really enjoy working with kids on trends fiction and trends mala trends smaller modality.

557
01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:54.780
Nathalie Lacelle: And, and I could see that they would engage in interpret without having been questions they would just do they will they could transform them the.

558
01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:01.860
Nathalie Lacelle: And while they transform they would engage in the origin of the end throughout the process, and I think that.

559
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:11.970
Nathalie Lacelle: can tell, I wanted to say before that I really admire that the how the process that the whole process of your your.

560
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:31.260
Nathalie Lacelle: Creation collaborative great, which is a really good example of the body in the machine in a postmodern conception of creation, but I still have what I really wanted to say, I still have a problem of representing the output.

561
01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:44.760
Nathalie Lacelle: I felt really bad I had no idea how it sounds or how we can see it so it's it's good in a way, because it's the process throughout the process.

562
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:47.160
Nathalie Lacelle: We can experiment.

563
01:21:48.480 --> 01:22:03.510
Nathalie Lacelle: All that we've talked about, and then there's this mystery at the end of how we can output so different ways, with with the technology, so I.

564
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:12.600
Nathalie Lacelle: I think I have to look into the examples that I don't know if there's word sounds of the words come into sound if we.

565
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:33.210
Nathalie Lacelle: And, and I have no representation and what I I don't want to speak too much, but that's The one thing that everybody that we talk to, in the last year's told us is what is a digital story so there's a.

566
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:38.820
Nathalie Lacelle: what's the answer right The big question like sales asked.

567
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:52.260
Nathalie Lacelle: about how do we teach it to well well how do we start teaching or talking about it, if we have no representation of it so that's that's our objective.

568
01:22:52.920 --> 01:23:04.530
Nathalie Lacelle: I think everybody here is how do we engage into the righty processes and how do we multiply the representation that we can make a digital stories.

569
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:12.180
Mark Marino: That are awesome anybody anybody from the other groups, when I give us a final thoughts.

570
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:21.810
Elliott Hedman: I just want to say thank you guys.

571
01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:32.550
Elliott Hedman: This isn't really a privilege for me because i'm not I don't come from any live background at all and it's really cool thing people who are on the same page.

572
01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:41.160
Elliott Hedman: Like most of my work is like talking to people like you know, maybe we don't have to do hard books, maybe there's an option, and everyone disagrees with me and I feel very alone.

573
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:51.240
Elliott Hedman: And here i'm like holy cow you guys are more radical than me I love it like you pushing me and all sorts of directions so it's really nice to be inspired by people, so thank you for being part of this.

574
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.880
Mark Marino: Thank you, thank you, my goodness.

575
01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.190
Kedrick James: Maybe we're on the same screen Elliot.

576
01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:02.310
Mark Marino: Well, sad to say, nicely done, I feel like that's kind of a MIC drop moment.

577
01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:16.500
Mark Marino: Alright guys well I hate to I really do hate to wrap up this panel, because I have thoroughly as someone who writes interactive stories with his children and has been thinking about this for a long time and has been trying to get people engaged creatively.

578
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:26.160
Mark Marino: With one of these oddball characters here and has, in just delights in the synesthesia of the whole skunk tails project Oh, my goodness, I just adore it.

579
01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:37.050
Mark Marino: And who, from time to time dips into Andrew clover cars workbench and comes up with crazy projects with Dean Larson as well, everybody here you guys, I just want to give you guys a great big hug.

580
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:52.080
Mark Marino: Thank you all for this final panel, it is it's got my heart singing and speaking of singing I it's very possible I will head down to the CAFE let's do some dancing some finger dancing and.

581
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:58.440
Mark Marino: and actually can wrap it all one more thing which I do one more thing, what do you got.

582
01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:04.980
Deena Larsen: Well, no, I really like to invite Elliot particularly to the discord for a moment, if you don't mind.

583
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:10.410
Deena Larsen: This would be the place where I normally have the wheelchair, and I block you in at the stage.

584
01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:12.150
Mark Marino: So at.
