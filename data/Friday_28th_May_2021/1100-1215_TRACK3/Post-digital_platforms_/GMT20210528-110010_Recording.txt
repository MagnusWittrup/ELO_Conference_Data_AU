00:17:56	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	I'll just have my lunch while listening, so turning off my camera :-)
00:19:57	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	Bon apetit!
00:21:07	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	I can see Rui, hello, nice to see you
00:28:47	Rui Torres:	Hello everyone, hello Oreto!
00:37:32	CLARA CHETCUTI:	I'm very curious to know how or whether ambient literature is distinct from the AR experience and also from locative narratives which do not require the reader to 'roleplay' or to focalise through a character
00:38:50	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Thanks, Clara
00:46:35	Astrid Ensslin (she/her):	I think expressively foregrounding obsolescence is also part of the post-digital.
00:51:34	Richard Carter:	^Definitely
01:03:37	CLARA CHETCUTI:	What a fantastic panel!
01:03:40	Mark Marino:	great work, all
01:03:50	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Thanks to all!I have a question about the notion of ’post-digital’. I’m thinking specifically of the notion of post-digital as it is invigorated by Erik Snodgrass as a kind of anamorphosis, i.e. a viewing device that enables us to see and understand something new about the colloquial and often quite elusive notion of ‘the digital’. In Snodgrass' analyses, this anamorphosis often moves through banality and critical self-reflexivity.So I guess this question is mainly directed at María, but I’ll be interested in all  of your takes on it: How does the work you have been investigating ‘reveal’ something about the digital – and what does it reveal?
01:04:17	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	(Ref. for my question: https://aprja.net//article/view/116069)
01:05:10	Mark Marino:	phygital!
01:05:19	Mark Marino:	and Fidgital!
01:07:46	Rui Torres:	I would like to ask a question, after Malthe
01:08:29	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Ok Rui
01:15:03	Mark Marino:	Q for Agnieszka, do you think that distinction between Ambient and Locative literature is epistemological or more like branding, drawing distinctions without real difference? Fundamental, essential, or shading/flavoring?
01:15:21	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	That's what I'm interested in, María :-)
01:15:26	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Thanks Mark
01:17:30	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Thanks!
01:19:49	Mark Marino:	phygital the NfT!
01:20:20	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	OMG NFTokens
01:25:34	Mark Marino:	they have in them the virus of how to read them!
01:26:55	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Banality is the point, it's a feature, not a bug ;-)
01:28:39	Richard Carter:	I do agree with this - an excessive emphasis on technical wonder in certain strands of digital art reduces them only to technical 'solutions', and gets in the way of other concepts they might be exploring, or, indeed, encourages a sense that only really big, complex forms of digital art 'matter'.
01:30:57	Mark Marino:	making is how we make it thru the pandemic
01:32:10	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	@Mark, I will write you an answer when we finisz, if there is no time. I tried do it now, when I realised we are running out of time but I am really bad at writing and listening at the same time. The shortest "provocation" (instead of answer) I can give is that there is no essential need to distinguish these fields.
01:32:25	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	@Richard: Absolutely, and the more complex the art gets, the more difficult it gets to grasp its poiesis beyond the spectacle of complexity
01:33:11	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Thanks Mark and Agnieszca, because time plies and we are now out of time. Thanks for your kindness.
01:33:31	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Agnieszca, I would like very much to have your contact
01:33:49	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Mine oretodomenech@gmail.com
01:34:38	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	@Oreto: ines.przybyszewska@gmail.com. I was going to ask yu the same (and to ask if you prefer Spanish or English) :-)
01:36:39	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Thanks all! Fascinating"
