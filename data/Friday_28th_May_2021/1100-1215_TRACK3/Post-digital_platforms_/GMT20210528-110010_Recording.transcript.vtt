Mar?a Goicoechea: The virus.

26
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.050
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Well, I think I can start why Atlanta arranges.

27
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.560
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: To succeed you pump in.

28
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.770
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The King.

29
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.160
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Particular.

30
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.070
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: song.

Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Okay, we have to enable sound so that is a problem sorry, so are you seeing are a slides containing.

32
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.720
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Yes.

33
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.330
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Yes, perfect a full screen now.

34
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:49.350
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: yeah morning Good afternoon, good evening everybody well the challenge made by yellow 2021 in delivering papers before its discussion allows us now to perform a kind of rereading of our argument.

35
00:03:49.830 --> 00:04:00.810
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So more than presenting you with an outline of our paper, hopefully, we will also be able to share new insight into what motivated us to write about this whole idea of language as a virus.

36
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.540
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So to recap in our paper our argument comprises four main transmission links.

37
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:17.340
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The first one regards the impacts of former pandemics in language and vice versa, leading us to think of William burroughs idea of language as a virus in most.

38
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:29.190
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Particularly the following quotes I have frequently spoken a word in the image of an image as viruses or as acting as viruses, and this is not an allegorical comparison.

39
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:46.080
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Secondly, juicy particles idea virus is going well beyond the allegorical, namely digital viruses that are becoming biological, in other words, organic resume matic and even mycorrhizal networks, made the viruses and language.

40
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.820
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Taking the Internet as an ideal ecosystem for the propagation of the former.

41
00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.840
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Thirdly, Alexander Galloway and eugene factors understanding of the relevance of networks and sub networks in viral transmission.

42
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:11.790
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And, once again, the role of the Internet as a network congregating many different traditional networks communications information, social, cultural, media platforms.

43
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:25.710
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And finally, the idea of goods viruses as explored in virology and viral therapy he replied to project art in quarantine a project that and I will explain in further detail in a few seconds.

44
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.650
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So together these four interconnected aspects insights as to ask the following.

45
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.960
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: If we are to recognize that language and viruses coexist with the experience and repercussions of every single pandemic.

46
00:05:40.470 --> 00:06:01.050
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: To what extent the concept of morality may suffer a new mutation by influence of kovats 19 most particularly, being a pandemic specifically connected to digital media and the Internet and, additionally, in which ways, will this digital infection contaminate post pandemic times Anna.

47
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.630
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So one way of looking into Israel project are implementing as an online rtc platform.

48
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.670
Mar?a Goicoechea: or a sudden network of its own.

49
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.590
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: develop adopting some of the male art principles and practices into digital.

50
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:37.740
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And it in its current stage acting parenting hosts more than 900 artworks produced between March and April 2020 for more than 300 authors worldwide and being reminiscent of a good viral like behavior as mentored by you, the project manager interface that we saw here.

51
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:48.180
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: functions as an art installation, including an interactive digital map in which users can track the arrival of the art books by day in location.

52
00:06:48.480 --> 00:07:00.990
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And in this way symbolic symbolically subverting a logic of infection contamination and contagions and by revealing, day after day, the transmission chain of artistic expression.

53
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.120
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So.

54
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.000
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The item current in platform presents two types of possible displays of use.

55
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:24.990
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Firstly, an individual gallery and here we can think of for world rooms or screens containing the individual factor like experiences of each of the participants authors in confinement due to poverty 19.

56
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:36.510
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And secondly, a collective gallery featuring featuring all of the artworks and presenting yet with another possible type of experience, there is the possibility of identifying.

57
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.410
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Artistic patterns from a global pandemic experience.

58
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:48.600
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And for the purpose of this conference, and regardless of their factual nature, we chose three art books from project art and parenting.

59
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.780
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: That falls under the spectrum of electronic literature and that will allow us to discuss the ways in which.

60
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.380
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Artistic representations from the pandemic are indeed permeating by digital media and aesthetics and apparatus.

61
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.560
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: and condemn confirming the idea that did utility mediates and every single aspect of this pandemic.

62
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:17.400
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Additionally, we believe that these three examples can be representative of burrows understanding or language in its material dimensions and infectious ability.

63
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:27.540
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: to generate and transmit meaning in both as a medium and a significant of its own and assuming it's a symbiotic relationship with your host.

64
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.630
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Sorry, so moving to the artworks the first ones that says offline in in it.

65
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:51.690
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: liberally leave a nice visual artist and photographer based in Paris Clara eben other makes use of screen captures and screen recordings of her mobiles videos photos and text notes.

66
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.270
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: In order to prove the performance of an l tentative daily life, while confinement.

67
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:05.970
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So being largely deprived from physical access to the outside world, the call for videos and photographs stored in her mobile phone.

68
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:13.410
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Are here used to reconnect to nature by revisiting a specific selection of summertime visual trump's.

69
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:23.430
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So, and then using a layer of textual notes intended to express in sorial emotional and psychological experiences associated with her memories.

70
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:35.370
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The author creates a fictional narrative and infectious literary constructor overlapping present reality indoors and weaving meaning into the otherwise isolated videos and images portrayed.

71
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.720
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: In our second example patient zero by Portuguese digital artist Vega.

72
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:52.650
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Another station of Le Elizabeth Jennings poem in memory of anyone unknown to me is used as part of an interactive online Memorial, with different kind of.

73
00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:01.020
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: mimicking the action of a virus the bomb is hacked and transformed into dust that death text destiny make sentences.

74
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:11.400
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: With these sentences dialogue with an interactive representation of the coronavirus transmission chain which individuals are here, represented by bright blue particles.

75
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.450
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Except for patient zero a single initially infected individual represented in contrasting read.

76
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:30.690
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: By interacting with it the observer was cursor is presented as the economy light accelerates the contact between infected individuals, reading the disease and increasing the death.

77
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:45.270
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: of individuals real name agent country of origin generated from actual neck national databases are finally made visible by the author humanizing otherwise undifferentiated anonymized articles.

78
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.620
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And finally, our third example and conclude our presentation here represents a distinct form of digital content.

79
00:10:53.250 --> 00:11:09.450
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: A different form of digital content created by Polish artist mathematician in composer Robert be wiser viral capital allows for the combination of the naacp in that the different viruses he gradually transform in.

80
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.810
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: generating you entwine.

81
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:23.070
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The newly generated winters are then converted in real time pointing tolerance sound outcomes and retroactive back.

82
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.260
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Thank you.

83
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.840
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: do go on, I know.

84
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.320
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: time for a nice cab service.

85
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.820
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: I thank you.

86
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.590
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So I will.

87
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.970
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Leave approach to ambien lita.

88
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:07.200
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: We were speaking yesterday about that embedded spoken manalo be an enhanced interaction metallic she's.

89
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.430
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: going to share.

90
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.750
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So do you see my screen yes.

91
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.260
Yes.

92
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:44.910
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Okay, so I will try to sum up my paper and, as I said earlier, I also have a lot of thoughts after the Conference, and I will try to speak, instead of reading so it can be a little more than five minutes sorry for that I think it's a little better.

93
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:51.000
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So, mostly my paper oh.

94
00:12:52.170 --> 00:13:02.100
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: yeah was focus on concept of a mentor literature, which, as most of you know, was proposed by in the project.

95
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.330
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: conducted by free.

96
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:16.950
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: English universities and it was a very interesting R amp D project focus mostly on the future of writing, and this project was.

97
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:31.890
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: conducted in a deep dialogue with publishing industry, so the main question was how to create text for the future, the literature that can interactive our.

98
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:46.680
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: On the end so out of the starting point the concept was about creating text which are able to respond to the side of reading so it was really close to look at writing.

99
00:13:47.610 --> 00:14:07.530
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: But in fact one day analyze the concept of ambient day for not only about physical surroundings, or the reader environment that becomes a part of story, but also about something like more metaphorical and the end our media ambient we are living in.

100
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:16.470
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So in fact i'm going to literature, there is also a problem of text which rob's readers that data.

101
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:28.350
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: And in fact the ambient literature is a kind of umbrella term to describe what was felt to be created in the project, what can be.

102
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:41.130
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: created in the future, but, as were to think about the past literature about and also about what we have now So to sum it up, I would say that.

103
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:51.600
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: The starting point is that, and this kind of literature, propose a new kind of outer written contract, because the reader body is not.

104
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.080
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: A problem to be needed, we don't have to lose our body to enter the fiction.

105
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:20.100
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: There are fully embodied readings and the text seems to ask something like that do reader lend me your body, please, and then I will show you my story so to describe this kind of literary experience I used free concepts are free free trucks or features.

106
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:35.340
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: All have in common, a kind of paradox, the kind of paradox that permits us to link, something that cannot be linked like fiction and actuality.

107
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:53.940
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So I use the polycom says Meta lapses and syllabuses because all of them permit us to thinking about those actualization about alternatives actualization of alternatives which are normally contradictory.

108
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.220
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So why.

109
00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.290
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: i'm into literature propose piling sisters experience.

110
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:15.360
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: When our settings became part of the story, it means that different layers of reality are blended so it's something like at the beginning of when does our.

111
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:28.170
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: When that protagonist is going through the city seeing the past and the present at the same time, so what was important for me is the fact that important part of the ability to to project.

112
00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:45.000
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: What interviews with readers and many of them said the same that they didn't distinguish the realities and that they really felt like in blended to reality, like in a real Palin sense.

113
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:59.520
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: And it made me thinking about that category Mecca lapses, of course, as we are speaking about the new media literature in context of interaction on the ellipses developed.

114
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:18.510
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: By mostly astor dancing and Alice bad and of course I was asking about ontological my collapses because it's a crossing border between reality and fiction our world not between different layers of fiction.

115
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:32.100
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: But I was inspired by the final part of the recently published built by our street and ali's when they asked about vr experiences as the kind of.

116
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:39.450
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: ultimate interaction on the collapses, and I found what is proposed an ambient literature.

117
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:48.660
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Even most old teammates that one, so our proposal my paper that the time enhance interaction or mental lapses by.

118
00:17:49.110 --> 00:18:03.960
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: But a thinking today, after all, the discussion we we could experience during this conference, I think that maybe just automate interaction on at Alexis or even ambient into action item that mega lapses will be the better time.

119
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:16.020
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: To describe that and what is crucial for this concept is the fact that those that don't ask you to enact and in any way they don't ask you to step in someone's shoes.

120
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:27.210
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: They just permit you to be yourself in your surroundings and at the same time be part of the story, and this is the third step for me.

121
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:49.530
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: What about this reader being a kind of protagonist I adopt the concept of celebrity I propose, many years ago by Irish up niche and it was proposed to describe the speaking I in literature, which is very paradoxical because it needs to be.

122
00:18:51.960 --> 00:19:14.250
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: fought at the same time as the real one, and as the fiction on one it was mostly used to speak about um about literature, in which the relation between the Alto and the speaking I was kind of a gay, so I felt about literature as a kind of our literature, in which you.

123
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:20.760
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: can apply this kind of paradox, to the reader because this reader.

124
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:38.070
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: functions in two different realities, at the same time, so I use the example here, which I didn't use my paper, but just to make it more visible, those are books or electronic books which have a kind of a hall.

125
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:50.250
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Which is a kind of a gap that can also be described a kind of mental lactic machine, because there is something in your fiction award that connects you with the fiction.

126
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:58.470
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So this reader its protagonist this elliptic you is the reader of flesh and blood.

127
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:16.140
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: And at the same time he can be active and frequently he is addressing of the narrative so I try to show it with three examples which are quite different and in which you can see exactly how it can be.

128
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:28.590
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: kind of how it can be realized and, of course, it can be profound it better, that I did in my paper, and then I go to the the other way of seeing this gap.

129
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:43.710
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: For the reader because if you need a gap in that story for the reader you frequently do it with a narrative structure, so I was thinking about a very frequent use of second person narrative.

130
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:58.470
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: intimate literature it's not the only one case, you can use also the other kinds of narrative but I was thinking about that also very old category of spoken monologue it's a kind of.

131
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:12.630
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: narrative in which this you is always present and the eye is speaking to someone even this someone isn't present so it's kind of paradoxical.

132
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:27.780
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Dialogue and it was proposed as attempt to describe this kind of literature, which was created, like the albert's coming in the fall, which was the first example of the kind of.

133
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:38.340
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: literature, so I was thinking that what happens in i'm mentally to try is kind of embodiment of the structure.

134
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:48.510
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: In fact, this gap for the reader who responds is put in the actual world so.

135
00:21:49.560 --> 00:22:00.840
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So you as the reader is the one who is the one which responds to the story and who is the one who should listen that.

136
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:17.580
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: In fact, those kinds of narratives can be because of that for also like a kind of literary work in form of this call or a kind of performance so to close my presentation I use the.

137
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:27.300
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: example of her long black hair but done at Cardiff, which is our do walk in which you can see all of those.

138
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:45.210
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: aspects and the pictures that the listener, is using to connect him with this story makes it obvious that it's just embedded form of spoken monologue and it makes this gap for the reader.

139
00:22:45.870 --> 00:23:08.790
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: really concrete and truly presence in actual world, so I hope that some of this example, hard to understand what I was trying to say my paper is still kind of a draft, and I will be really helpful for any advice and comments and I will try to stop sharing my screen.

140
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.350
Mar?a Goicoechea: Thank you very much.

141
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.310
Mar?a Goicoechea: We cannot hear you.

142
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.170
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Oh sorry.

143
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:31.080
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I was reading your paper is morning and I feel like you were with me, reading the few book.

144
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.730
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: With your with your overview about.

145
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.030
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: That.

146
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.010
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Okay let's go ahead with Maria will go to.

147
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.660
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: With the after protecting a post digital world.

148
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.380
Mar?a Goicoechea: In queue for data we're going to share my screen.

149
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.920
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Yes.

150
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:27.870
Mar?a Goicoechea: Yes, Okay, thank you very much i'm going to try to summarize the main ideas I wrote in this.

151
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:54.390
Mar?a Goicoechea: essay which has this very pretentious title Var object in a digital world, I wanted to reflect, maybe, especially on two labels that have been used to define sets of artifacts that I think are born of the see out of the same context and talking about term both digital and post Internet.

152
00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:03.750
Mar?a Goicoechea: In particular i'm going to focus on the work of ideas that use instagram as an art gallery for executing their work or.

153
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:17.250
Mar?a Goicoechea: On the other hand, to sabotage the platform from the inside, these are works that come from the artistic sphere, but I think they bear a family resemblance to electronic literature.

154
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:40.020
Mar?a Goicoechea: The US explore the narrative process in the construction of an artist identity, the changing territories of human machine artists expect director interactions and digital analog materialisation Actually, I think we are all three panels or all three papers.

155
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:51.210
Mar?a Goicoechea: Addressing the same issue, the art optics that are being produced can be classified as for digital like physical and digital construct.

156
00:25:51.630 --> 00:26:00.030
Mar?a Goicoechea: That in have it in a myriad of different possibilities of mediation and convergence, the spaces of mixed reality.

157
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:13.350
Mar?a Goicoechea: So, as the artist explore the platform's potential as exhibition space advertising side and conversational I their digital objects reflect the tension.

158
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.370
Mar?a Goicoechea: between a nostalgia for an analog craftsmanship which rebels against mechanic perfection.

159
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:38.010
Mar?a Goicoechea: And an interrogation of human creativity that propels us into the future, to an ever more profound symbiosis with our technological habitus, so let us first define or very quickly i'm just going to point out a few.

160
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.470
Mar?a Goicoechea: And elements or signs that I have found.

161
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:54.480
Mar?a Goicoechea: When did these terms appear well, they have been around since the year 2000 when, for example, electronic music composer King concerning.

162
00:26:54.930 --> 00:27:08.430
Mar?a Goicoechea: Inspired by Negroponte a sentence digital revolution is over, he decided to refer to type of non academic self taught music electronic music, as well as digital.

163
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:23.640
Mar?a Goicoechea: And from that moment the pulse digital has been associated with this process of commoditization in our everybody can become an artist mean you know, using do it yourself technologies low tech recycled materials, etc.

164
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:44.790
Mar?a Goicoechea: So they're there what I think is interesting is to locate what kind of features these works share also with electronic literature, you know this logic of extruding data, this new gold, you know, both as a creative practice, but also as a method to attribute cultural value so.

165
00:27:45.930 --> 00:28:06.000
Mar?a Goicoechea: there's also this question of how are we going to make our art, something that can also be sold, you know, so there, there are certain features like this nostalgic retro mania that Kramer was also describing this mix of old and new media in their creations.

166
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:25.410
Mar?a Goicoechea: So the post is the condition requires the artist, which is really everyone to become his or her own agent using platforms, such as instagram as exhibition venues to attract audiences and make their art viral So in this sense.

167
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:37.020
Mar?a Goicoechea: The the platform is at the same time performing several roles, you know and that's what I would like to analyze here, at the same time.

168
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:48.480
Mar?a Goicoechea: I think it was concurrent to the emergence of post digital as a term artist myself some also refer as port post Internet at.

169
00:28:50.010 --> 00:29:01.560
Mar?a Goicoechea: To discuss a series of you know, artists, that began to reflect on the impact of the use of the Internet and its technologies, but using creative venues that were outside the Internet.

170
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:15.210
Mar?a Goicoechea: Returning to the plasticity of objects in the physical space of the gallery some critics have also seen this as a way to be able to sell you know net art to transform it into an object.

171
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:30.300
Mar?a Goicoechea: So Murray sell some quotes RT your current who describes this type of art, as a result of the contemporary moment inherently informed by ubiquitous authorship development of attention as currency.

172
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:39.840
Mar?a Goicoechea: The collapse of physical space in network, culture and the infinite reproducibility and mutability of digital materials.

173
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:51.810
Mar?a Goicoechea: As, as I mentioned the paper, there are so many you know critics that are very negative with respect to post Internet art is very famous the post by Brian tricor.

174
00:29:52.290 --> 00:30:11.880
Mar?a Goicoechea: entitled why I hate post Internet art that says that post Internet artist to art would porn does to sex, you know, implying that was the only thing that was Internet artists want is to be successful in the art world, more than anything else, that they are not.

175
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:29.460
Mar?a Goicoechea: That they lack the craftsmanship abilities that we associate with artistic production, like the only thing well made is the commercial gadgets that they introduce in there, you know exhibitions well, I think we need to analyze the more that you know.

176
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.110
Mar?a Goicoechea: Each.

177
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.920
Mar?a Goicoechea: piece to see you know if it's really.

178
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:45.390
Mar?a Goicoechea: Something just commercial or if he has an interesting message to say so, this is what i'm going to describe that.

179
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:53.310
Mar?a Goicoechea: This artist share something in common, they are concerned with the the possibilities of.

180
00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:02.520
Mar?a Goicoechea: and introducing this tension in their artistic creations between the different layers know that we have it at the same time.

181
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:08.460
Mar?a Goicoechea: So the digital ontology of the digital art is not have a single.

182
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:16.230
Mar?a Goicoechea: Quality we can find physical objects in digital environments digital objects in physical environments like very.

183
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:31.680
Mar?a Goicoechea: Different you know combinations and technology is moving our horizon of expectations, even beyond because each day new possibilities know are being created, but what i'm interested in analyzing is.

184
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:44.340
Mar?a Goicoechea: That, even though the range of possibilities is very wide and artist, you know with their imagination, they decide to even take them beyond the our expectations.

185
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:54.510
Mar?a Goicoechea: Each time, you you use augmented reality or augmented reality in your work you're also indirectly posing a question now.

186
00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:04.560
Mar?a Goicoechea: And positioning your work, regarding your concept or your understanding of reality is physical reality lacking and that's why you have to amend it in this way.

187
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:15.960
Mar?a Goicoechea: Or what is the correct balance between ourselves and our technological processes and, and this is what I would like to to analyze in this works which are the.

188
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:27.330
Mar?a Goicoechea: First, digital processes that artists are introducing in the works, how do they use instagram so how is this is strategies, you know integrate.

189
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:37.680
Mar?a Goicoechea: The platforms and as well, of course, this list is very personal and maybe we can discuss it later, but I have identified some.

190
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:46.320
Mar?a Goicoechea: strategies that I have found in several you know works, so I think they're they're not just connected to one particular.

191
00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:59.010
Mar?a Goicoechea: proposal, but they are very frequent now like recycling technological detritus or this type of post digital actresses we contextualize in the platform.

192
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:06.960
Mar?a Goicoechea: communicative strategies by taking it outside and introducing it in the physical space for example of a gallery.

193
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:20.520
Mar?a Goicoechea: or the other way around, how we use augmented spirituality to introduce physical objects, like a SOFA that we want to sell in this very ethereal you know ambien.

194
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:32.040
Mar?a Goicoechea: So that we are somehow regaining the artistic or in the digital space, or should we say just the commercial you know attractiveness.

195
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:48.270
Mar?a Goicoechea: Another strategy will be flooding the platforms veracity principle, and these are the ones that I see a sabotaging the logic of the platform from the inside, and also creating in plausible exhibit seizing instagram and also.

196
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.840
Mar?a Goicoechea: making explicit this tension with.

197
00:33:52.950 --> 00:34:05.340
Mar?a Goicoechea: instagram as a space to to show work, you know as opposed to a physical gallery, so I have, like several examples to showcase.

198
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:17.970
Mar?a Goicoechea: A strategies that I have found, like, for example, the artist corey Archangel in one of his most famous works as super Mario cloud what he has done is to you know.

199
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:31.020
Mar?a Goicoechea: eliminate from the day the game, the graphics that are in the foreground so the only thing that remains is the path from moving clouds.

200
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:56.280
Mar?a Goicoechea: And this is really connected with what cousin he wrote in his article about the importance of detritus for ground by product in the past, digital art that by exploring the blind spots, you know those things that we don't pay attention to like the detritus of our society, we may.

201
00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:10.890
Mar?a Goicoechea: have a better idea or a better description of who or how we are as a society rather than the perfected piece of art, I use found very interesting, the work of and within elevator.

202
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.840
Mar?a Goicoechea: She has been.

203
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:20.340
Mar?a Goicoechea: Very she has become famous in in Spain thanks actually to her use of instagram.

204
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:37.680
Mar?a Goicoechea: she's very active there she communicates frequently with her audience and she feels feels compelled to bring this digital consumption and communication modes of instagram into the physical gallery so she actually with this.

205
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.770
Mar?a Goicoechea: exhibition, which is one exhibition inside and other.

206
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:58.500
Mar?a Goicoechea: She wants to highlight how we are in an instagram you know consuming images just with a click of our finger very fast and there's always this need for visual you know gratification.

207
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:19.980
Mar?a Goicoechea: Another artist that I think uses the the digital space of the platforms to recreate an aura it's in this a Spanish artist based in Barcelona, let me see if I can activate the immediate.

208
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.790
Mar?a Goicoechea: Well, what he.

209
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.030
Mar?a Goicoechea: uses the space of.

210
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:37.890
Mar?a Goicoechea: keys.

211
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:55.650
Mar?a Goicoechea: I think i'm going to stop the video, because otherwise I won't be able to talk well what he does is he creates different pieces of furniture or fabrics and he introduces the object that he wants to sell in this very surreal.

212
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:12.990
Mar?a Goicoechea: scenarios the spiritual spaces in 3D and is a safe finally in those digital spaces, the object acquires like any theory or a sense of belonging and I think it's interesting also.

213
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.040
Mar?a Goicoechea: For example, how these artists.

214
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:28.590
Mar?a Goicoechea: That use 3D rendering software to move beyond or to move sorry from one level of reality to another.

215
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:37.110
Mar?a Goicoechea: For example, Lucy hardcastle studio based in London and with I think 1000 followers on instagram also very popular.

216
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:50.100
Mar?a Goicoechea: She investigates the tension between technology and traditional crafts, now, and she also says that who work, you know emerges from this post Internet pieces.

217
00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:13.470
Mar?a Goicoechea: So in this case the process moves like this from the qualities of physical objects like liquid stuff materials eyes and their textures She then takes these qualities to her, you know digital objects through 3D sculptures and digital images and then these.

218
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:30.300
Mar?a Goicoechea: suffuse back in physical materials like printed fabrics to make rocks to make curtains etc, so there is a kind of complain, you know effect because sometimes you kind of distinguish is this.

219
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:46.230
Mar?a Goicoechea: For example, is a 3D rendering was actually a piece of glass a when they use their photographs to talk about their project they realized that the spectator kind of distinguish any longer, this is like a kind of game or cloning.

220
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:55.770
Mar?a Goicoechea: From the physical space to the digital and backend so as we have seen in Lucy hardcastle raising your and low beta.

221
00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:07.200
Mar?a Goicoechea: There is a return to the physical object craftsmanship is important, the still the spaces seem to be clearly separated so in the case of Lucy hardcastle is a bit more difficult.

222
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:20.460
Mar?a Goicoechea: Then I would like to show you mine well there's there's just more artists finish the work of Amalia woman and her project excellence and perfection.

223
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:30.330
Mar?a Goicoechea: is one example, I have used to talk about this strategy flouting the platform's veracity principle which is already very weak, but in this case the.

224
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:41.190
Mar?a Goicoechea: The artists Texas know it gives it another child to school well in her work that you can read in in my paper she completely makes.

225
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.940
Mar?a Goicoechea: a parody you know of the type of profiles that.

226
00:39:45.780 --> 00:40:03.630
Mar?a Goicoechea: Young girls leaf or using instagram and she, of course, confuses her friends and family because they don't know if she's for real or just making things up, but she completely tells a fake story through photographs, like, for example, this other artists intimidate from NATO, who made.

227
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:14.670
Mar?a Goicoechea: A Facebook project pixelated in her photographs were in both cases where is subversive is that the real identity of the artists remains always elusive.

228
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:31.620
Mar?a Goicoechea: Either right faking up and now yet popular ego or self centered in it before the platform has a chance to do it, so the artists invents new norms for the algorithm to deal with, and my final example is.

229
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:42.420
Mar?a Goicoechea: A juice fast the parallel compression artifacts and he is his project, I have chosen it to to.

230
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:51.330
Mar?a Goicoechea: show this last strategy that a theme impossible exhibit site in instagram would heat, it is.

231
00:40:53.010 --> 00:41:01.080
Mar?a Goicoechea: Constructing a secret location what appears to be like the room in a in a gallery or an exhibition space.

232
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:12.180
Mar?a Goicoechea: There is is impossible for any expectation to actually reach that space, because we are not informed of its existence until everything is completely destroyed and brought to ashes.

233
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:26.310
Mar?a Goicoechea: So the process was recorded and then post produced to comment, the size or decrease it in different digital images and and what remains in the is.

234
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:44.370
Mar?a Goicoechea: kind of archival project a series of recorded videos and photographs that are disseminated in the networks so as an animal lover and stories in this piece, we also find an exhibition inside another exhibition, so what is.

235
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:55.590
Mar?a Goicoechea: discuss really is the the exhibition space, the container because the the art objects, in a sense, become by now.

236
00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.100
Mar?a Goicoechea: So with these different examples and to conclude.

237
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:18.300
Mar?a Goicoechea: I want to say that artists can use instagram and other platforms in various ways, but what I have found is that they very often use it either to disseminate their work, you know.

238
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:24.480
Mar?a Goicoechea: Or to pose a critical stance regarding the algorithms commercial logic.

239
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:42.300
Mar?a Goicoechea: They are aware of the commercial objectives of the platforms and they tried to skew or a prop appropriate them, you know, depending on their intention so very often they they are a mixture of post Internet like consumer and posted it up, probably more reflective.

240
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:44.070
Mar?a Goicoechea: and

241
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:57.840
Mar?a Goicoechea: What I see is that, in the same way that was Internet art became a reflection from the outside, from you know outside the digital space on Internet reception habits.

242
00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:10.920
Mar?a Goicoechea: We have also observed in this digital electronic literature, this type of overture tours all the works that might not be strictly classified as electronic literature.

243
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:22.620
Mar?a Goicoechea: But praying from a similar experimentation with platforms and artistic creation, they are Travers by are going through computer programs mechanic spaces.

244
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:33.810
Mar?a Goicoechea: And they're also trying to reach out, you know new audiences by all the strategies, you know necessary so as close relatives in the artistic field.

245
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:47.310
Mar?a Goicoechea: We have identified same impulses in electronic literature as in you know this type of Internet art, but what I think will be interesting, is to reflect what happens not to them.

246
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:51.540
Mar?a Goicoechea: To to our concept of medium when.

247
00:43:52.560 --> 00:44:00.420
Mar?a Goicoechea: One space seems to reproduce nearly with with perfection now the qualities of the other medium.

248
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:13.620
Mar?a Goicoechea: So Spanish critic hermosa, for example, he believes that the digital art the the idea of the medium is completely destroyed with the message know.

249
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:33.390
Mar?a Goicoechea: Maybe destroys is too extreme but both digital art, certainly in our problem at ISIS the idea of medium through these interconnection of different layers and all the possibilities, but I think, maybe we can discuss this later that as a new.

250
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:55.560
Mar?a Goicoechea: forms of artistic expression that are always very self reflective with regards to their material medium in electronic literature as in computer art in general, since new technologies appearing constantly we don't seem to be able to go outside this constant very repetitive.

251
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:07.740
Mar?a Goicoechea: Meta reflection regarding the medium now, so this is something that maybe we could discuss now, what is certain is that artists are.

252
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:16.530
Mar?a Goicoechea: A forever altering the platforms, most of consumption and production by making them explicit.

253
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:30.840
Mar?a Goicoechea: but are they, as I finished with my article berating audiences to this perpetual state of distraction by fostering the platform logic of giving more more images to consume.

254
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:42.150
Mar?a Goicoechea: Or are they trying to recuperate this sense of contemplation litecoin instead inside ourselves to to be able to connect with the art.

255
00:45:42.720 --> 00:46:01.200
Mar?a Goicoechea: piece, and at the same time, find some insight now that helps us live better and there has tried to put too many ideas in my paper i'm really sorry for that that maybe now we can discuss them and stop sharing and that's it, thank you very much.

256
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.840
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Thank you, Maria Thank you to your.

257
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.840
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: applause for all of you.

258
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.860
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I am learning a lot with you.

259
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:18.510
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: For me, what is interesting to see is how your your papers dialogue with each other.

260
00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:29.190
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: mm hmm in the perspective, you you offer from my gaze over global at last and map.

261
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:43.620
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: With the platform Sunday surroundings, the context the ambient and after that focusing into the Ad object, but that very.

262
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:50.940
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Close abroad, my deed goes again to the global.

263
00:46:52.290 --> 00:47:16.620
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: So it's really, really interesting and I also can see the police me off of that physical object that more while is then mobile phone the smartphone and which is like a service with most of the examples you are explaining.

264
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.210
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: And not only for reading also for creating.

265
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:29.790
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Like like the works do go and then I showed and the vt Dan Maria.

266
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:45.900
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: defined he's that double condition be to our physical we took their the object, we take the object with us every day in our life.

267
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:53.520
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: it's it's a thing to take into account and and also, I can see.

268
00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:02.400
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: In all your papers that play with the movement with moving and don't move.

269
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:13.650
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: It was very interesting for me to sit in my ass and I moved in Alberta work with their.

270
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.740
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: i'm taking photos.

271
00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:30.270
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Of a at object, but the person was and the people they didn't move and the art objects were moving.

272
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:39.930
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: So very, very interesting and not is not a panel what.

273
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:41.130
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: would be.

274
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.590
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: let's see if we have some questions or comments in the chat.

275
00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.390
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I think la.

276
00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:53.610
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: cloud it.

277
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.750
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Do you want to say it Clara or prefer me to read.

278
00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.370
CLARA CHETCUTI: You can read it out to be like.

279
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:21.360
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I said that road that i'm very curious to know how or whether ambient litter is these things from the augmented reality experience and also from your captive narratives which do not require the reader to role play or to vocalize through a cat here.

280
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.490
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: For me as.

281
00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.320
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Well, thank you Clara for this question because it's just.

282
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:45.180
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: The main part of my problems and maybe I can start with that that it's not clear for the ability to project researchers and in case of locate if narratives.

283
00:49:46.440 --> 00:50:03.840
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: They even have to tap to like why we are not located and but at the same time, then they use examples of located narratives, so this is a very complicated, but to give you a good example.

284
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:16.470
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: I discovered that the example I use that the first one, which was proposed, which was presented at the last conference so that's why I use that.

285
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:23.580
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: It is a walk made by my students at it was made out of the cost of located narratives.

286
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:35.340
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So for me it's example of lucrative narrative so fast second that the second one project was which was made with the same technology.

287
00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:47.910
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: For me it's example of located narrative but it's not ambience so I tried to catch the difference here and I thought that this use of phone, because in.

288
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:55.980
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: jail negotiate school at the beginning of the story, someone who is talking to you.

289
00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:07.860
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: and says that you have this form as a kind of connector between them and even a lot of ironic comments how all this fun is.

290
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:21.360
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: And all bad things which happens frequently with located narratives that you lose GPS signal, or something like that so in the story all of those things are.

291
00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:36.030
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: made by the old phone so it's not the fault of the story of the technology that's the fault of the reader okay so so it's just part of making key part of the story, and the second project.

292
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:51.720
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: was very like a game, but was connected to the lot of more, as we have in our city, so it was the story in which you were as a listener reader.

293
00:51:52.140 --> 00:52:02.790
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: asked to discover the story of one more which is missing in this our story, because it was just you know replaced with the other thing.

294
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:16.830
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: And you go from one point to another, and you got some puzzles to solve, and so on and so on, but you are on a listener, so this fall and this kind of narration.

295
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:32.940
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: is only something that permits you go through the story, so you are not in fact part of the story world, and I think it's that the main difference, and when I thought about.

296
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:45.090
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: us through it and as leland Alice bell concept, this was for me, the main difference when we think about interaction on my collapses as.

297
00:52:45.630 --> 00:53:02.250
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: As they described that mostly in the previous articles you think about kind of using your body as a tool to interact with the story, and there is no dis federal step to permit you to be part of the story.

298
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:10.980
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: So this is one point, and the second thing which is um I also think, very important.

299
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:24.120
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: I think it's not sin in my paper but in abundance literature, the second person, which invites you to be a protagonist is invite you to this role playing.

300
00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:38.010
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: is frequent but it's not always case of that and I use the example of imaginary, which is a wonderful work, so if you don't know it's please read it's really amazing.

301
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:55.140
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: piece in which you are part of the story, and the stories written the second person narrative so it's a perfect example that it's not the you narrative and draw playing case and then you have.

302
00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:12.000
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Things like i'm things I mean pieces like okay to put into a brief in which generation is in fact the first person duration, so there is no rock like for you to to play.

303
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:27.540
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: But the reader is the one who needs to listen to the story so it's exactly the case of spoken monologue and then in fact you discovered that your form was also.

304
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.870
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Somehow you know freedom by ghost.

305
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:49.350
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Like it happens to the protagonist, so there is no there's one moment in which does not or a protagonist sighs i'm speaking to you as my mother was speaking to me but there's no specific you.

306
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:59.100
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: Addressing in the story so that's why I say about it selectric protagonists not celebrity Q, but that does so many you know.

307
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:13.740
Agnieszka Przybyszewska: dobbs in this area so it's very, very nice question but also really difficult to be asked words just in one moment, so thank you for that, and I hope that I, I give you some kind of response.

308
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.270
CLARA CHETCUTI: Yes, you definitely do thank you, I suspect, is a bit thorny.

309
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.040
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: i'm in the esca.

310
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.860
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: And monster.

311
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:25.860
Malthe Stavning Erslev: Yes.

312
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.570
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: You want to yeah.

313
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:29.760
Malthe Stavning Erslev: yeah I can just read it.

314
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.770
Malthe Stavning Erslev: I guess that's the easiest.

315
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:40.140
Malthe Stavning Erslev: way, first of all, thanks to all of the panelists or presenters in this thing that has been accumulated into a panel.

316
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:47.970
Malthe Stavning Erslev: That was been really fascinating so I have a question about this notion of post digital which, of course, was in maria's.

317
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:57.480
Malthe Stavning Erslev: Presentation but what's also have a title for the panel so i'm guessing all of you kind of fit into this in some way, if not, then please correct me.

318
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:04.530
Malthe Stavning Erslev: But i'm thinking specifically of this notion of post digital so Eric snodgrass uses it in one of his.

319
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:13.020
Malthe Stavning Erslev: His articles as a kind of enter morphosis that is like a viewing device through which you can see, specific things about something else.

320
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:24.630
Malthe Stavning Erslev: In this case, about the digital so through the post digital in this in this version it's not something that comes after the digital right it's not a temporal post is more like a conceptual posts so.

321
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:36.540
Malthe Stavning Erslev: insistent existing alongside the digital but something that makes you able to see the digital so some kind of almost collected entity that you can then reflect upon through the postage.

322
00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:43.020
Malthe Stavning Erslev: And even though this is the concept is is usually difficult to grasp essay as a simple thing.

323
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:49.530
Malthe Stavning Erslev: And so, so, in the end that's actually works through this kind of self reflexivity and banality that I think.

324
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:55.860
Malthe Stavning Erslev: You all have in some parts of your work, especially Maria, of course, you also pointed to.

325
00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:04.260
Malthe Stavning Erslev: And so, so in that case it's not it's not something you weren't bringing in and assist specific reference so So my question is then.

326
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:22.200
Malthe Stavning Erslev: If we take this premise of the Pope digital as Anna morphoses as something that reveals something about the digital what is it then that the works that you have been engaging with what what do they reveal to us about the digital as something.

327
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:27.330
Malthe Stavning Erslev: And it's a very broad question but i'm just interested in hearing your responses.

328
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:34.020
Mar?a Goicoechea: Okay, shall I start and then maybe you gonna.

329
00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.280
Mar?a Goicoechea: Do and, yes, can Maybe you can add something.

330
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:57.450
Mar?a Goicoechea: Of course, your question is very, very difficult and I wish I could answer it, but I can only point to my own, you know reflections on this subject, I have the feeling that Well, this is something that artists forever have consulted on, so this is nothing new, but what I think is that.

331
00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:11.430
Mar?a Goicoechea: What this digital artists are doing with respect to digital culture is something similar to what last one three year and dogma did with respect to cinema, which is like kind of making explicit.

332
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:18.270
Mar?a Goicoechea: The forms of communication and reception that we have not realized regarding help.

333
00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:40.590
Mar?a Goicoechea: In no matter how unnatural they are how artificial they are they they have been integrated in our lives or without us really paying too much attention so like they They point out, they make very conspicuous forms of communication and reception that we you know, sometimes.

334
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:50.760
Mar?a Goicoechea: We fall into the trap without too much reflection and i'm thinking, for example, about this idea of constantly the visual gratification that these artists.

335
00:58:51.750 --> 00:59:02.310
Mar?a Goicoechea: A us because sometimes they use it for their own benefit, you know and they continue to propagate the same logic that the platform does, I think it was Kenneth Cole me.

336
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:12.990
Mar?a Goicoechea: Who said that whenever we need to like the platform algorithm or that they there is this idea hey there is a consumer, you know look around there so.

337
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:26.070
Mar?a Goicoechea: I think they make certain things more conspicuous when when you see people recording and within elevate as exhibition with their smartphones and then following instructions like.

338
00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:33.480
Mar?a Goicoechea: uploading those videos to their own instagram stories and being being part of the work but also.

339
00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:42.270
Mar?a Goicoechea: Consumers in instagram then it hit me not like wow This is like we go to an art exhibit.

340
00:59:42.570 --> 01:00:00.960
Mar?a Goicoechea: Like we got to the supermarket is more important than the selfie that we take or the video that we regret and actually what artists all about you know this is like a childish form of interaction with art that I think she she points out, or that was my impression.

341
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:07.350
Mar?a Goicoechea: I don't know if you want to add something else.

342
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:27.420
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: From our point of view, I think we can add something else from at least two different perspectives one is that while we were reading and, yes, and Maria Maria papers.

343
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:45.360
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: We started rereading our own paper and having into account the theme of the this panel which it is a real panel and what came to mind was that there are a series of convergences.

344
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:50.280
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: But there is at least a small divergence that.

345
01:00:51.570 --> 01:01:03.660
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: turns everything here around the inverse of the whole logic which is taking into account the works that you analyze and the work that we analyzed through art in quarantine.

346
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:17.880
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: For the first time, there was the need to use digital media, because we were all in confinement, but there is a thing that we started thinking about.

347
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:25.800
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Which is the referential reality of these each one of the works sent by participants.

348
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:36.720
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And there is a reference to the rooms, there are spaces and we can also analyze it by analyzing the visual patterns of the collective gallery so when we.

349
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:50.250
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: came into your your turn the term you use the digital which in transcription with we discovered that it is worth $50 so that, when you say.

350
01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.430
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: turns up that.

351
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:58.950
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: yeah so it reminds us of Berlin Berlin gotchas I think that she was telling words, a few years ago.

352
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:01.380
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Sorry.

353
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:07.530
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: But the the feature told is that that's the whole logic in the whole circle, if you want.

354
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:21.720
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The disruption processes used by artists pre before coven 19 and after coven 19 will bring we think we think we do not know this.

355
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.890
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: A different at least a different perspective to the notion of post digital.

356
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:39.690
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Because we will not be immune to this US So this was also our our question, we will say it, and then, if you want, you can add that later something to it.

357
01:02:40.140 --> 01:03:00.990
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And the question was how do you feel that these artists in these works any even your idea of post digital can suffer small changes after this pandemic, so this would be our arm our question you want to add something else um.

358
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:07.050
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Well, in our just looking at the art in parenting.

359
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.850
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Our books that we've shown some some of them, but.

360
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.690
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: it's difficult to it's difficult to.

361
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:31.680
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: understand what could have been different in those works if the the artists that produce them weren't forced to use, you know digital medium and.

362
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:52.650
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: But what we can say on analyzing those works is that the influence of the digital it's not only through the use of the technologies or the medium, but we felt that there was even an aesthetic influence on the digital on their works and that.

363
01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:04.800
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: We also came to the conclusion that it was related to the virus itself so it's again it's if you got to understand it if it was another topics of the virus influence that because.

364
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:19.800
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Somehow the two things converge and we felt that the seven some experts of the digital aesthetics were useful to talk about some experts of the video.

365
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:32.100
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Sorry, of the virus experienced by as an immaterial airborne transmission think some always this duality between what's visible and what's invisible.

366
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:43.470
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And the artists F played with that using digital like once and this dichotomy between inside and outside world, you know windows and screens there this.

367
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:51.270
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Call it visual tropes because in the Arctic, we don't talk about you didn't talk about these in the presentation, but we regard to.

368
01:04:51.930 --> 01:05:16.230
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Some of our be vibrance methodology in the Ad was members in projects, so we were looking for you know kind of psychoanalytic approach in the analyst is of the images and but we felt that in this works, the digital was presence in all kinds of ways, but the question is how to go versus.

369
01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:22.800
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: How will it be about when we return hopefully to the.

370
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.430
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: outside world, how will this digital infection force digital infection will affect.

371
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.870
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Well, mercifully artistic creation.

372
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.380
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Because there were lots of artists that.

373
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:48.450
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: and your few that never have never worked with digital medium before and they took the opportunity to experiment, so they rediscovered.

374
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:53.490
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: This medium and this different language, we can say so.

375
01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:54.630
Mar?a Goicoechea: we'll.

376
01:05:54.990 --> 01:06:01.530
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: we'll see how it is, but we wanted to ask you this, if this pandemic experience or more this.

377
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:12.390
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Experience of artistic creation during and then we'll can affect your idea of post digital what you can park them.

378
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.560
Mar?a Goicoechea: Well, as I told you, before we started.

379
01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:31.560
Mar?a Goicoechea: He somehow ignored the pandemic completely when I was selecting the works, and then I realized oh my God what am I doing, but what I thought is that, as he has happened in education in many other.

380
01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:38.460
Mar?a Goicoechea: Fields the pandemic has just accelerated a process that was already begun had already begun.

381
01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:57.570
Mar?a Goicoechea: So, in the same way that artists that had not been acquainted with digital tools, now they kind of look the other way I see this is there is like a point of no return and i'm not very sure of how we are going to come back to normalcy I don't think there's going to be.

382
01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:06.330
Mar?a Goicoechea: an easy return, because we have been altered forever, you know, and I think that.

383
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:28.170
Mar?a Goicoechea: Would would be interesting to see is like I really like that you brought the wearables atlas never seen a again to the picture, because this was pre digital completely, but it already had this logic of infection and how images, you know also are.

384
01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:38.010
Mar?a Goicoechea: It talking about themselves and they have in them the virus of how to read them and they are contagious so.

385
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:43.770
Mar?a Goicoechea: The Internet has become you know what boots atlas but in a gigantic scale.

386
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:54.780
Mar?a Goicoechea: And when you search for images in Google, would you find you know these connections through simulated but sometimes the simulated is not only graphical or iconic.

387
01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:03.510
Mar?a Goicoechea: It also has to do with the keywords that people have used to introduce them so it's a mixture of languages and you get a very, very strange.

388
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:25.320
Mar?a Goicoechea: Like unconscious combination of different you know artifacts the machine has done it, but maybe an artist would have you know arrive to similar you know strange concatenation or you know just a position of images and I think is here to stay, you know so of course I don't like this post.

389
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:36.750
Mar?a Goicoechea: prefixes because we are just there you know, and I think it will be more interesting to see what's coming ahead, and you know I prefer protocol as a prefix.

390
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.690
Mar?a Goicoechea: Because he he opens.

391
01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:50.070
Mar?a Goicoechea: A new world of possibilities and and digital technologies seem to be continuously receding this horizon of expectations.

392
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:55.950
Mar?a Goicoechea: And I think this is also something that makes a lot of the creations by now.

393
01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:10.890
Mar?a Goicoechea: Because art normally you know is classified as something exceptional when it's confronted to the limitations of the medium, but when the medium is constantly expanding and offering new possibilities for the creators.

394
01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:25.440
Mar?a Goicoechea: How can you detect that something is the perfect work of art, with respect to another thing you know we are sometimes distracted by this kind of digital fireworks like oh my God, how did you do, that no but.

395
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:37.200
Mar?a Goicoechea: In fact, maybe the graphic designer the process is completely you know, simple and absurd, but people that do not know you know those.

396
01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.500
Mar?a Goicoechea: processes and very easily surprised, and I think that's something.

397
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.400
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Different okay.

398
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.940
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Thank you, Maria because we have two more questions.

399
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.020
Sorry.

400
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.140
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: We will it always.

401
01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.170
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Has a question really.

402
01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.600
Rui Torres: Thank you everyone.

403
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:58.290
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Hello.

404
01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:07.710
Rui Torres: How are you graduations to our presenters for the wonderful ideas expressed in your talks I have a comment, perhaps a question.

405
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:23.250
Rui Torres: Regarding and and the logos aren't in quarantine project, the online gallery which currently hosts more than 900 artworks and I ever read your paper and there's a moment that you write something like.

406
01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:45.660
Rui Torres: Good viral like behavior intrinsic to male art, culture and communities working as seven networks, I love these ideas of good viruses, because they allow us to proceed art as transmission and contamination words that I hope will not leave our vocabulary.

407
01:10:47.190 --> 01:11:00.660
Rui Torres: And I agree that male art, as you say, but also process bowen or even fluxes activities they constitute important antecedents of the the language art or electronically trigger.

408
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:17.490
Rui Torres: i've been doing some research lately with collective publications of the 60s and the 70s and there is an international turbulence and complexity even chaos that presides over the creation of those publications.

409
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:40.020
Rui Torres: and digital platforms, they seem to appropriate some of the aspects that we find in male art, culture, allowing for the integration of a variety of a static coordinates and practices, however, most times they are, they are constrained by the fourth and c's and limitations of software code.

410
01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:53.490
Rui Torres: So I tend to believe that custom made platforms, such as yours embracing collaborative networks, they contribute to the expansion of elite more than just simply.

411
01:11:54.150 --> 01:12:07.770
Rui Torres: Adopting or adapting ourselves to existing platforms, because they allow artworks to be disseminated in informal networks and to circulate in alternative formats and channels.

412
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:28.590
Rui Torres: What I mean to say is that the words you presented seem to intentionally differ from normative status of official museums and galleries and therefore they have a good viral like behavior like I think all electronically Twitter should ever do you agree with me your when.

413
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:31.620
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: I can start and then.

414
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:39.690
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Maybe you can add something on instagram so yeah Thank you Louis for wonderful comment, yet I mean.

415
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:46.470
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: When we started the yards in parenting project from one day to another, we woke up and.

416
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:59.190
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: started thinking, what can we do working in confinement and we have to do something with what we few things we we can do, or we want to do, and one of the things that came to mind was to use.

417
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:13.380
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The networks of my alert which we work weighted with because, mainly because the it seems like a bit contradictory in terms of they use a snail mail.

418
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:25.650
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: it's apparently opposite to the idea of digital networks, so there is a small detail that changes, the whole thing here, which is.

419
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:42.420
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: We started by using mail art networks through social networks, this is an interesting thing because we came to 900 heart for artworks that are not exclusive of male art artists.

420
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:51.420
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: In the result was artists by works by professional and also non professional artists, which is part of our.

421
01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:53.610
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: curator ship.

422
01:13:54.780 --> 01:14:08.820
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And the thing is that we managed to see after it was completed this first stage, we managed to see this apparent in congruence has a continuity.

423
01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:20.040
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So, for the first time that these artists were needed to use it to communicate through platforms, that they were not, most of them were not used to.

424
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:34.860
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Another thing, and I will leave this to Anna is the when we start to compare it with other projects that started at the same time, but using social networks such as instagram, for example, covina art museum.

425
01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.080
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Well, thank you for it it's really nice to know that.

426
01:14:41.220 --> 01:15:04.740
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: You can feel that is a good virus goodness in the project yeah so we had our life was very much facilitated because we use the sub networks of mailers that already had a lot of the principles that we wanted to convey in our projects, so it was intentionally obviously.

427
01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.320
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: But.

428
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:13.170
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: There was a second reasons for doing it obviously for.

429
01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:23.310
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: aesthetic reasons when can say because we we really wanted to create a platform and mainly an interface that.

430
01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:37.500
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: also convey the an artistic and symbolic message right, so we could only do that it was a custom and problem interface, and then the more.

431
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:49.440
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Critical or political stance and say even of trying to escape the logic of like I don't know how many projects of art in quarantine that.

432
01:15:50.610 --> 01:16:01.320
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: came to existence during pandemic popular museum is one of them in instagram but we felt that these projects with we're very much limited to.

433
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:19.740
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: The the platforms that that we're hosting them and in most Specifically, these are, it could be that museum instagram we really wanted to escape that consumers logic of really instantaneous consuming of image.

434
01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:29.130
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: And we wanted, because we wanted to create a network within sub network and and we felt that those kinds of.

435
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:37.170
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: platforms didn't allow us to work with these two levels of individuality, but also creating a collective sense.

436
01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:41.340
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: of union between all of the artworks.

437
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:43.890
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: So.

438
01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:51.690
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: It was off radical and the reasons that we chose to do it, but of course always.

439
01:16:52.800 --> 01:17:04.470
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: we'd we had a purpose for doing it, and we also wanted, then I will finish it briefly, we also wanted to go to what will now become.

440
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:11.520
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: A second stage of the project, which is to give continuity to it, taking into account the changes that we are.

441
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:25.590
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: feeling in through this pandemic, one of the things that the reviewer said, and we appreciated that was can you talk about future developments of the Platform, the idea here will be to present another mutation in.

442
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:33.660
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: This place with the idea palimpsest by that and he has also mentioned in that made us think that if we invite all.

443
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:47.760
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: 300 or 350 artists to rethink their work, we can do another mutation in the platform replacing in showing how they feel or artistically about what we are now living and experiencing.

444
01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.450
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: costume a platform gave us that possible.

445
01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:54.150
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: I think, will give us that possibility yes.

446
01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:55.080
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I am.

447
01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.270
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Sorry, we find out one final remark that I.

448
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:58.260
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Remember okay.

449
01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:12.570
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: Sorry, we really wanted the mail art will also had a purpose, because we didn't want to being a digital projects and we felt that in other digital project type we felt that.

450
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.370
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: There was a tendency to create more visual.

451
01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:25.830
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: visual art works and we wanted to broaden broaden the scope of the outputs and we had.

452
01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:34.770
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: In it resulted in a multiple gender and types of workloads we have classical pictures that were we had i'm remembering this.

453
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:49.950
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: really nice lady that paints that makes watercolors and asked for her nephew to photograph the water calls and we have a photograph of Lady next to the water cooler so we wanted to create a more inclusive inclusive.

454
01:18:51.180 --> 01:19:02.190
Ana Gago / Diogo Marques: projects, and I think that's in the spirit of the male art to think you were saying combining professional mercial and non professional artists.

455
01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:07.170
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Okay Okay, we we have out of time now.

456
01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:09.120
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: So thank you all.

457
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:15.930
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: For the questions they comment on the dialogue see you later in another screen space.

458
01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:17.520
Mar?a Goicoechea: Thank you.
