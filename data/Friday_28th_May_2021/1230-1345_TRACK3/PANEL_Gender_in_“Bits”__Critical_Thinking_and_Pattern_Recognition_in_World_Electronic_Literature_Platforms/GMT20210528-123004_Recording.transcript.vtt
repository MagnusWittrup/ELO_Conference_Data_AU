14
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.050
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A few months ago.

Mark Marino: So.

18
00:02:47.580 --> 00:03:09.090
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: it's the well Alice stopped opening the panel and talk and i've done this with with my well they are all good friends so say my colleagues, but actually she's a very good friend of mine, while you're messed up, so I will first talk and then I will pass.

19
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.580
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The the talk and that would be.

20
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:30.030
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Maya that unfortunately she sent us a video, and this is one topic that we should also discuss the problematic be moms having to works and being a conference, and then there will be asked him and then Mr units, but.

21
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:43.740
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: i'm Joanna de rosario well, many of you already know me to quite a lot, as I teach digital culture a police technical Milan and while i'll introduce the ready nuclear nuclear MAIs la.

22
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.930
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: She she's a specialist on Latin American.

23
00:03:50.100 --> 00:04:00.330
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Electronic literature and she's focusing right now on on on women and Latin American elite said.

24
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:12.570
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The gender issue there, and she collaborates a lot with digital the Center of digital culture in Mexico and she's based in Mexico, right now, she got.

25
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:21.720
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A very prestigious scholarship from the government of Mexico and now she has to pay them back she so she she has to be based there.

26
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.990
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So that's it briefly, then I will introduce the Maya and as in but just not to twist time.

27
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:51.120
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So why we came up with this idea well everything I have to say thank you all so tomorrow and see because everything starts with her and another couple of women in in buffalo many, many, many years ago in another interesting elite conference, there was actually a poetry at the time and.

28
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.370
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: We actually were discussing dasha do we're not too many parlance, we just women, and in fact now it's totally different and very happy.

29
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:11.070
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And the picture that you see that you see here, I was taken in another conference what is another poetry in 2015 and 2015 in in in in in.

30
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.880
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In Buenos iris and was really we opened the conference, there was just the panel, we were all women.

31
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:39.240
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And at that time was quite rare so i'm very happy that in a few years, things that really, really changed, so what we are presenting especially this first part of the of the panel is the sanam going studies that we have well I have started i've started in in in in 2015.

32
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.970
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: When I got my Marie Curie and it was like focusing this actually on.

33
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.630
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Gender and women in in in gender and women writers in in La and.

34
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.230
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: And while you see in a while.

35
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:08.970
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I will talk more about the do Europe side of the word, and the North America, do I will also talk about dead dead dead dead.

36
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:22.050
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: you'll see collections and European ontology on electronic literature so we'll also talk about that part but before saying something into it have to take a step back.

37
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:36.150
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Because I during this song going studies, I focused a lot about collaboration is something that I already presented in a paper and CEO conferences in Portugal.

38
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:53.910
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Five years ago to say this is really something that i'm working on since 2015 2016 do I had a break, because I have a baby, so I stopped for almost one year doing things just teaching but that's another stuff.

39
00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:03.420
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So, by doing this, have really worked on collaborations as well and see since collaboration looks to me so very.

40
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:20.700
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: it's so good it's so important in elite I also try to clarify and to myself first what means to collaborate in elite so have divided into two main.

41
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:34.620
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: groups say like that, so they create collaboration and and gas collaboration so gas collaboration, or those collaboration which are simply not declared and it's not so rare I mean.

42
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:58.230
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Something that also happened in in in in the past than with the classical and illogical literature, if you want, you might recognize the picture the picture here the likes of example mess and ago smokey that look, most probably, was the one that goes rider many of.

43
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:09.660
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The famous very famous French writer, so this is this collaboration, I was already existed and also discuss collaboration as a.

44
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:26.190
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: flash have tried to to see the direct kind of couple of tendencies in in in in in in elite when when it comes to declared collaboration so from from one side you have defined roles so and.

45
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:40.830
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Other The other possibility and you don't you don't have defined roles, so they collaborate, but you know who did was Okay, and if there are just too old to declare there so normally, there is no.

46
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:57.660
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Real defined collaboration so they're both authors, maybe even if one is just writing dead, the linguistic tax and the other one is like coding or other understaffing graphic designer etc, if there are more than two authors that.

47
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.610
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: That did the worst done by he.

48
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:20.670
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Also starts to be more more clear why is that because I want to see what kind of collaborations that happens in women, women and women literature as well, so kind to to to to to do some very fast distant reading.

49
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:29.550
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: On washer what happens in collaboration and and and women at the very beginning, well this this.

50
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.320
This.

51
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:52.980
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: image that you see right now, this graph here it's i've tried to map out the publications about electronic literature, excluding the new one that has been published last year that concerns Caribbean and Latin American.

52
00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:06.780
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I was trying to lead you to because this is something i'm working on as well bodice more focusing on on annoy your size that, so this is, you see briefly how.

53
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.160
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The publication really works.

54
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.700
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: has grown quite loud to me.

55
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:31.500
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The lc three almost alone published almost the art of the all words that will publish them with the other two llc and the European and technology electronic literature, so this.

56
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.280
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Is an ontology of electronic of European electronically teacher just to make it clear.

57
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:55.470
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So, briefly, but what happens with women in there on Sunday i'm focusing I mean I have lots of this data, because i've worked on that a lot I have data on from below i'm data from emc have data from the and to do, I mean i've.

58
00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.780
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: I think that's I.

59
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.060
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Taking data from anywhere.

60
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:12.720
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Bottom want to focus on publication because maybe you're not a kind of an agency, and I was more curious to to show this things today so here you have.

61
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.870
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A slide and maybe you see here white clear.

62
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:39.690
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: they're mounted real mount This is our absolute value so you have the real amount works published in the oC one that maybe we need to remember when said 2006 2011 and 12 2016 so for the three yellow car collections.

63
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.770
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So you have the de de de de amount of.

64
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.760
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: works published and then you have those.

65
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.500
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: created by women.

66
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:02.970
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: All those created where at least one of the older daughters was.

67
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:18.210
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A woman So you see, there are some some differences, but this is more interesting, I think, because if you look at this you see dasha the percentage of.

68
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.130
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Women.

69
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:35.100
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: publishing their own works is growing has grew, of course, but I think that there is quite still a lot to do, because, as you see dasha.

70
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:50.040
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Just women publishing works by themselves, like with a single voters female voters or two still quite a minority compared to to to to to the rest of off dead.

71
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.770
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Especially.

72
00:12:54.330 --> 00:13:15.180
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Especially if you if you look at the yellow see three you you you, you are happy they're growing, of course, they have been grown, but still lots to do you know it's not the half anyway, and I have to decide this this image from the LCP database to see if this.

73
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:33.540
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: was also I mean if this this minority that is so present in this also y'all see the quantity literature collection three that was publishing and in 2016 was also the same things, for example in the.

74
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:54.750
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: database that is so important, especially for for us in Europe Scott did a wonderful job with this SIP database that was happy to collaborate data most university you've asked around this big project, but so I was comparing data and, in fact, of course.

75
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.000
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: That.

76
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:09.930
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The items on on on men were much more than on on women, but still, especially if we consider sorry, you have to go back second.

77
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:26.700
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: If we have to consider the electronic European and Chinese literature, well done, you have to understand why there are not so many works by women, published there and I have to say something as well.

78
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:48.870
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The old that the third electronic literature collection is an amazing word collecting words from everywhere in the world, so from Japan to to to to China, there was something missing and the very first two but seeing many I think and it's so potent concern.

79
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:50.820
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Many.

80
00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:10.830
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: race and and and and even nationalities are missing there, and of course there is a call for works, but I think that maybe as a as a Community, we have to be a little bit more inclusive and consider yourself this this science and this aspects.

81
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.450
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So.

82
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:30.600
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Our collaborations again, this is our absolute value so so women how we do collaborate, because sometimes currently seems that we are not to able to collaborate to to one another, I don't know if it's left calf networks, probably are.

83
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:42.690
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Better ways So you see here, for example in the electronic literature in the European returning digital there was no collaboration between women at least no declared, then there is the ghosts.

84
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:50.310
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: and other stuff that i've said at the very beginning of this presentation so here, you see that.

85
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.920
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In fact, for example in the glc three.

86
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.010
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: This collaboration is.

87
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:11.790
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A little bit glowing compared to the second one don't want to take too much time staff lots of statistics here so today so really a statistical one.

88
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:31.380
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: So this is again on those were like absolute value, this is a do some mistake here, this is absolute values, and this is our relatives, but anyway, then would have done to you have an idea of what i've done here how I map out this this.

89
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:42.330
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: This collaboration between or among women in electronic later than one of my question for this ongoing study is that.

90
00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:56.730
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: If there is any differences in creating elite that women are somehow bringing or showing so one things that have done is to to see.

91
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:24.060
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: If there were like more works tagged with poetry or with narrative in this in this works and because there is a statement by Virginia woolf that declares that women prefer to write a narrative to to to to to poetry because narrative is a new john that they can manipulate that.

92
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.870
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: We women can be pretty to the guide is not a rigorous standard data ready poetry and do.

93
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.300
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: plush reactor lead language has differences between tags with poetry and narrative.

94
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.620
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: But it's a tricky thing because sometimes.

95
00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:52.560
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Both botox access for the same tone for the say work so sometimes these data should also been.

96
00:17:53.250 --> 00:18:05.490
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: reconsider from our close reading approach now just the distant reading so defining quite well if that works was really belonging more to poetry or two to two narrative that the other things that.

97
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:18.570
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: have done, and I want to show you that I stopped because otherwise that ticked off me and it's I work on titles and see if there is the differences in choosing titles.

98
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:33.450
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In women, this is something i've like redoing like to know if you have familiar with the work by more ideas on this and readings that are like do you this with with.

99
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:48.810
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: English literature as like counting nouns continue title see if the trend have changed in in in the years in the Center is and that's what i'm doing so here you have some kind of.

100
00:18:50.040 --> 00:19:05.850
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Data on that so if we turned my question was like do women prefer to have single title like one word like a shot lunch or you prefer to have more words certainly a little bit like.

101
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:18.990
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: descriptive etc, you have some some some somewhere here, but I was stopped here, because otherwise take time, or just for myself and I would pass my I will pass.

102
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.230
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: The wait, let me.

103
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.420
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Do this otherwise.

104
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.780
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: She cannot.

105
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.210
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Share here.

106
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.450
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Either should be you should be able.

107
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.300
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: No idea to share your screen right.

108
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.240
Nohelia Meza: Okay.

109
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:43.530
Great.

110
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.890
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Yes, mark everything starts with Maria mercy, so we serve.

111
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.130
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay.

112
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.650
Nohelia Meza: everything's okay right yeah yeah sure.

113
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.120
Nohelia Meza: whoops.

114
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:31.830
Nohelia Meza: Okay, so well thanks everyone for being here and, of course, thank you, your banner for organizing this panel and for bringing us all together once again.

115
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:43.500
Nohelia Meza: i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i'm still in Bristol however i'm going to be in Mexico soon, but still, this is part of the big project, I was working with the Mexican grant that dimension.

116
00:20:44.070 --> 00:21:02.790
Nohelia Meza: So today i'm going to continue the conversation about like how these like i'm dendur patterns are fixing fixing my work electronically to two platforms and I will tell you about the research that I am currently developing so as jovana mention.

117
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:13.440
Nohelia Meza: My line of research is more focused on Latin American electronic literature, so when I began to wonder what was the role of women creators in.

118
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:26.370
Nohelia Meza: The Latin American scene, I began with simple questions such as like how and when did it start and how to investigate and keep track of these contributions in the history of electronic literature.

119
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:38.640
Nohelia Meza: So the first thing I did was, of course, to check what has been done about read written about it investigated and then as Steve mentioned in, as we all know.

120
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:55.560
Nohelia Meza: The influential work of medea means yeah with the addition of women tech lead in 2017 was one of the first things I read and that actually motivated me to know what was going on in the Latin American scene in that sense.

121
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:06.090
Nohelia Meza: Because you know, there is such chapter there with my Claudia Casa which actually a researcher so like Latin American literature when how in.

122
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:19.440
Nohelia Meza: So that see that there was a spark for the investigation there and then I also want to mention that, while I was at least in 2020 working with Professor thea pittman.

123
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:33.750
Nohelia Meza: She began the her research on Latin American electronic to created by women, we should publish in 2018 and then she encouraged me, and it is thanks to her and to her support.

124
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:44.310
Nohelia Meza: That I actually you know, decided to began my own investigation, so I wanted to clarify that we ended up in this paper being published in 2020.

125
00:22:46.260 --> 00:23:04.350
Nohelia Meza: Which is like mainly focused on like Latin America, and he was published in Texas heat that more having like a general geographical overview and that's what i'm going to tell you about today how I developed the the researcher to write this paper and what am I doing right now so.

126
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:16.410
Nohelia Meza: I had to, of course, when I look at the different databases and that we are all familiar with the different collections, of course, the MC.

127
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:32.100
Nohelia Meza: A big database Siberia project in Spain, which is also very important for my research, the word that the the the cultural Center in Mexico city's been doing to, and also with two very recent.

128
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:49.260
Nohelia Meza: and important projects from two of my colleagues carolyn again Sir in Chile in Virginia rota invested, which is currently in the hat like these original project, which was to map the electronic literature.

129
00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:57.060
Nohelia Meza: Written or created in Chile, with our initial project, which was called data culture team.

130
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.550
Nohelia Meza: And in that project, it has a small section dedicated to electronic literature, which are used for my research.

131
00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:12.660
Nohelia Meza: And then return, he was doing at the beginning atlas and now they are both building big databases that they actually released like both projects are two weeks ago.

132
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:18.720
Nohelia Meza: So I wanted to underline that, because it was it was very important for my research, and of course the.

133
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:28.140
Nohelia Meza: Other anthologies, which is also important to mention here, because the anthologies ITO that you see here is going to be difficult in.

134
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:43.740
Nohelia Meza: They are hosted in Hawaii Hawaii and Argentina, so it was really interesting to have all these different exchanges with them in order to see which works, they consider to be electronic visitor in which works.

135
00:24:44.220 --> 00:25:04.170
Nohelia Meza: were written by women were interested for me and, of course, one of the biggest I want to say a achievements, or one of the biggest thing that they did during this year of research was to interview almost 40.

136
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:14.130
Nohelia Meza: let's say 40 women and these interviews where we're actually fed my research and gave me all the answers and, of course, like.

137
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:23.340
Nohelia Meza: brought of nuance of what I wanted to do in the future, so I did that to start, and then I selected for three.

138
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:34.110
Nohelia Meza: It works in the point in which I am right now is like in the selection of record for us and then after i'm going to use like a completely.

139
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:41.370
Nohelia Meza: Different theoretical framework in order to analyze What I do want to analyze and this works and then after.

140
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:48.630
Nohelia Meza: What i'm going to show you right now is just like a histogram of the of the different works and in relationship to the.

141
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:57.750
Nohelia Meza: country and the agenda of creation and some graphics and, of course, like some possible for the publication, I already shared and then some as.

142
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:11.880
Nohelia Meza: A small editorial I wrote for the Center of the city and probably something that I will publish in Libya in 2021 so the here is a histogram and here we can show how.

143
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:21.690
Nohelia Meza: What the different colors of course refer to the country, aware of the authors and with the corresponding English words that I chose.

144
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:36.540
Nohelia Meza: And we can see the different how it has what there are gaps, of course, as we can see from 1996 1990 1986 to 1998 but after we can see how things begin to move a little bit how different countries.

145
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:47.970
Nohelia Meza: begin to come into into place and into the scene and what I did, to try to help me a little bed was also to to put this like dashed lines to you know, like, for example.

146
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.750
Nohelia Meza: For the release of flash so to see how many of the words were programmed in flash and how many of them use it to them.

147
00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:05.640
Nohelia Meza: And how many they were a store in in celebrants so that really helped me to create this like timeline not only of creation, but also of technological tools that the.

148
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:14.850
Nohelia Meza: Artists were using so that's one of the things I wanted to show you and also, if you see, on the other side, you have this light green that.

149
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:25.470
Nohelia Meza: Red dashed lines will show also some of the iconic authors that I had also had in mind, which are mainly men, because one of my.

150
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:33.090
Nohelia Meza: let's say audited so for the future is also to do a comparative study right, which will be more interesting in that sense.

151
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:45.390
Nohelia Meza: And okay so then after i'm going to show you these other graph that I were working on so basically this graph shows is a relationship between the general world of the artists and the year.

152
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:59.670
Nohelia Meza: And the age of first creation, so when I was doing this interview is one of the questions was like when did you create your first electronic dictionary work so when they answer that I was doing this small database in order to plot this graph.

153
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:07.560
Nohelia Meza: And I discover different things that i'm going to talk about all that, right now, but I just wanted to tell you that day it depends on the.

154
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:20.670
Nohelia Meza: The timeframe, in this case I divided by 10 by decades, so it depends on which they could you want to investigate and and analyze and who is sexually or who was creating the first work during those.

155
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:27.240
Nohelia Meza: those years, so another good question will be is like what's going to happen in the future, because, as you can see.

156
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:37.770
Nohelia Meza: At the end of the graph you have like the an actress that is 26 years old, that that's they say that the limit of the graph but you also have another one that is 21 years old.

157
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:46.320
Nohelia Meza: That was born between 1970 1980 so of course these data, as I said, is based only on the 43 women that I chose.

158
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:53.790
Nohelia Meza: But that's why it's also important to consider like the new works that other people have been doing now, because one of my.

159
00:28:54.570 --> 00:29:06.030
Nohelia Meza: goals to its to apply this methodology to the new anthology of Latin America and Caribbean electronic literature and also to the two databases of the clinics I previously mentioned.

160
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:15.030
Nohelia Meza: And just to grab her up because I know where enough time is like you know, of course, any, as I said, I need to expand the database for my research.

161
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:21.300
Nohelia Meza: I in the interviews, I have also face all these challenges of digital obsolescence.

162
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:27.810
Nohelia Meza: As we all know, so what's also important to learn how the artists are like preserving their own work.

163
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:39.120
Nohelia Meza: Or are working in collaboration with institutions or centers of the culture to preserve their own worth and how they how they are facing busy that obsolescence.

164
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:47.190
Nohelia Meza: And then another thing that I wanted to mention is that 80% of those fortunately I want to underline that, because now, I have.

165
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:56.730
Nohelia Meza: i'm working with other numbers continue to create electronic literature, what is it, which is also interesting to see what has been the development of those artists in those.

166
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:09.750
Nohelia Meza: let's say four years and then of course we have at the beginning of the strong presence of Argentina, Argentina, Brazil and Chile and which has also you know, like some connections with like.

167
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:25.380
Nohelia Meza: For example, with Brazil with the relationship with concrete poetry, so we can also talk about that maybe and then another thing is the the first that through the interviews, I did not discover, but I.

168
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:35.310
Nohelia Meza: I realized, who were the first like Latin American elite translators, that in this case was from English to Portuguese.

169
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:43.530
Nohelia Meza: And also, like other languages were involved in this whole diet creation faces, which also is like English and French.

170
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:53.250
Nohelia Meza: And another important thing was that the impact that artistic residences have, especially in the decades or.

171
00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:03.360
Nohelia Meza: I think it was in the 90s, how important it was for artists in Latin America to go and develop works during that artistic residences.

172
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:10.830
Nohelia Meza: And just to add the last nutrition is for the graph like you know, there is a tendency that shows that the artist first each of.

173
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:29.850
Nohelia Meza: The artist he first creation of elite work decreases by five years each decade, so I will finish with that, so we can continue with the other presentations and, once again, thank you for bringing us together and thanks to the yellow for the space to share my research.

174
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:36.600
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Thank you know any other interesting and did so now we have a video.

175
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:44.250
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: You should be able to see it it's Maya they'll be there, she teaches.

176
00:31:45.570 --> 00:32:07.650
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: A university professor university with Madrid and well she's very interested in in in feminist studies so she she she she's especially some that especially for for English electronically to to let my talk, you can see the screen right.

177
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:11.520
Okay.

178
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.170
yay.

179
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:23.790
Nohelia Meza: Do.

180
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.280
Nohelia Meza: You need to show this some.

181
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.990
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Oh.

182
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.830
didn't see.

183
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.680
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: You can't see the screen.

184
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.740
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay.

185
00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:43.860
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: You can't hear.

186
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.360
Nohelia Meza: But we cannot hear you.

187
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.590
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Our gosh.

188
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.730
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Dan Dan I will interrupt it because I can hear so the know.

189
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.450
Probably.

190
00:32:53.790 --> 00:33:02.340
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Okay, you know I shared the sound I shared everything but probably something doesn't work, please yes.

191
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.240
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: But it's already solved.

192
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:07.830
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: There you go.

193
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:19.260
For the electronic literature organization conference of these 2021 year pause pandemic.

194
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:27.600
i'm going to give my conference entitled closely enough stephanie strickland scintilla also had me yo and Paul ryan's sleeping limps.

195
00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:39.870
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: In the close reading, we have to discover how a literary texts works it consists of for reading process, followed by a literary analysis.

196
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:49.170
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: There was they find more appropriate to analyze electronic literary works are using hermeneutics to interpret the text on semiotics in order to maximize the use of science.

197
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:59.820
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Furthermore, as poetry is inseparable from motion to close reading of the electronic prime slipping lamps is also going to have analyzed apply in effect a theory.

198
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:14.100
have an artist is present in the study of the tutorial literature, because computation uses science, which are both human readable and machine execute tuco.

199
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:24.450
As Albert or male marketable and polo here we explain humans tend to be text realized to interpret and in the field of digital humanities.

200
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:36.060
And hermeneutics traced and data field in a hermeneutics approach to the digital the researcher works on the filters sofitel part of electronic literature.

201
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:55.590
are very thorough may introduce the concept of imagination within within he instead of an eye or when that human sq meditations are externalised into technologies and that human imagination has its analog in the digital dynamics of articulation between databases and algorithms.

202
00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:12.000
He poetry sounds sound and he made make it close to art web space increases the visceral contents of poetry, however, the visual content of poetry has always been there in Japan other rosario words.

203
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:24.960
poetry and art in general have always been seen on aims synonymous with subjectivity with creativity, a poetry comes from the avant garde movement tradition.

204
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:35.430
it's already in it and novelty has even put up into question with some critics because they believe that electronic forms are only reproducing 50 avant garde experiments.

205
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:43.710
However, media provides new elements and electronic poems are original for their themes visualizations and new ways to be manipulated by the real.

206
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:52.350
individual port reports, having learned from avant garde concrete and visual poetry reproduce the pleasure of political connection.

207
00:35:52.830 --> 00:36:01.890
And in a place, like the Internet or the changing information so fast some digital forms propose a different relationship with time, linked to the rhythm practice.

208
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:11.250
Christopher funkhouser explained that poetry poetry and computer poetry the related to poetry is computer poetry in prehistoric digital port repeats at.

209
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:28.170
Therefore, if an ICO and cannot be analyze like a printed one using hermeneutics semiotics and effect theory, it will then be enough in the closure didn't have a slipping lamps the technological elements have to be also known described interpret it as part of the work.

210
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:40.920
i'm going to allies sleeping limps how was a sleeping claims making process slipping claims is a digital kinetic verbal visual collaboration between prize winning poet.

211
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:51.630
stephanie strickland programmer since hellos and cameo and I do refer Paul Ryan, it was published in electronic literature collection to edited by.

212
00:36:51.960 --> 00:37:03.540
Morris may not really and stefan's this flashpoint resource, including in women over cyber fundamentalism collection rated by myself, I have had with their funny I was in the arm same knowledge base.

213
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:13.920
In the introduction of slipping lamps the other explains that making this work made them newly aware of commonalities in code in poetry and in quotes.

214
00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:27.870
In slipping links we scroll the text and we find two columns of texts that appear at the same time, and the reader has to read one column, and then regenerate the text again to read the order.

215
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:37.050
stricter laws and make reference to what intern who coined the term.

216
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:50.490
homeostasis to describe the develop mental systems whose necessary path created seems to be done to return and therefore make your lips and sleeping lips, the water reads deployment text the.

217
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:59.790
text reads image capture technologies and ryan's image capture technology reads the water, the offer compares reading.

218
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:05.700
quotes to silent reading of poetry experiences are transmitted without being said.

219
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:21.390
They believe in a future your thirst, we live in a future in which readers can get used to lines of poetry loops up code and chaotic patterns in order to read they're generating futures fine and choose a life sustaining necessary puff.

220
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:32.220
i'm going to do a close reading of slipping lists slipping lamps cover presents the 10 images which correspond to the second segments of the point.

221
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:38.430
The photographs of the oceans are in different natural colors being blue green yellow and white and the predominant ones.

222
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:46.020
are basing your two groups, it could because either Daddy signifiers use only one of the five sensory channels sites.

223
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:52.380
There signifiers seem to be symbol, although they signifies where the readers associate the colors with.

224
00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:59.040
can be more complex the signifies could be blue for calm green for peace, yellow for heat and white for emptiness.

225
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:05.130
By clicking on one image, the user finds a video with flow, the emphasis of the electronic poem.

226
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:14.790
which do not follow any semantic order some verses can be read others cannot be read, because our first overlaps, the other already discovered by the close of the image finally.

227
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:24.090
Wendy they stopped, we can be read, but as the verses do not feed into the logical meaning they cannot be fully understood the worst our watch more than bread.

228
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:30.330
However, even if the content is not clear through images we can experience filling and energies.

229
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:44.970
The minion doesn't need to be understood, when allies in electronic poetry, do you want to de rosario quoting and assessors explained this intentional ambiguity of meaning, according to the rosario Professor sixers the digital writing freeze the language from the primary.

230
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:58.980
of meaning open it up to the unintentional not intentional reading movement, the importance of visualization mix this kinetic poems closer to an artistic work than to poetry itself.

231
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.740
Direct always have enjoyed slipping limbs, from my point of view, reading.

232
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:14.100
What is watching the videos and floating versus and the other is clicking on scroll texts and reading the segments of the poem text, while watching the video or the background.

233
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:29.520
slipping lips software trucks, the motion of the water movement that occurs within each of the videos meaning can be found in each word in a segment of important all segments of the turning point container video with floating sentences which imitate handwriting.

234
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:49.320
I interpret that the fact that the text can be read by the handwritten text in nature cannot, as the idea that we can control reading a text, but we cannot control nature natural elements come and go, there is a continuous movement everything flows like interactive lots pantry.

235
00:40:50.730 --> 00:41:06.000
liking everything with overs Korea sanest poem images and metaphors are just oppose combining words irrationally my personal interpretation is that the point is explaining writing digital poetry process as caffeine in a stone where nobody has died before.

236
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:25.620
slipping lips, is one of the most famous works of electronic poetry, due to its quality unoriginality as far as experimental experimentation is concerned.

237
00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:34.110
As well as the video photography and the uniqueness of in the form of the segments of the poem in the research world of electronic literature, there are few publications of close regions.

238
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:42.690

239
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:52.890
commentary contemporary writers and artists will be useful as a contribution to the future, academics, in order to better understand the literary production of our times.

240
00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:01.170
Not only at the commercial level, as it happens with printed literature bestsellers or novel prize winners, but also to support the production, distribution.

242
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.350
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Thank you for this interesting.

ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Great okay thanks right i'm going to try to go fast, because my my was is a long presentation basically.

251
00:43:54.450 --> 00:44:07.230
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And a well what am I trying when I i'm trying to do, recently is i'm researching and i'm assuming edition so and I work on intermediate semiotics and cognition so.

252
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:20.760
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Recently i'm exploring and I tentative ways to materiality and is in display in this case, of course, electric literature and art and how do they interfere with.

253
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:32.040
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Other forms of material a human materiality, so to say, so I am I have chosen and in the work of.

254
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:44.340
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: These very famous Australian net artist and game designer mess breeze and she's also a member of this activist group known as the third faction.

255
00:44:44.820 --> 00:45:01.650
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And where she explores from a critical perspective and and exposes a demonic narratives and attitudes that generally pervade game environments, so we will see that she merges and gender aspects also in car.

256
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:11.730
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In co work know so because of time limitations i'm going to look very briefly at for poem anthropocene anthropocene.

257
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:26.970
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And, and the collection of the verses and in 3D and which is a collaboration with very well known and electronically teacher artists, some of them actually in present in this in this panel.

258
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:41.250
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And the the underlying hypothesis, as I have already mentioned, is that net art might actually in pants and readers understanding of key aspects related to critical issues.

259
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:51.660
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: As well as encourage public engagement with those issues and, in particular, and with regards to human and non human actions in the anthropocene.

260
00:45:52.410 --> 00:46:10.290
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And in terms of theory and methodology I use actual network theory and extended human approaches I not gonna have time to go into this in great detail in the presentation today but they're they're backing my my research so first.

261
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:20.730
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: With regards to her poem anthropocene and reposting I won't go into the detail of analyzing it, you have it down below there on the screen.

262
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:33.600
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And and in 2011 she published this book, which is called human readable messages messenger where she talks about this type of code work which she uses in this poem.

263
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:42.330
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And also, in this book to write it's a kind of a diary know and and and she has this question on the on the back cover of the book and.

264
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:54.030
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And what do you get if you stitch together standardized literary conventions think the monumental output of bill Shakespeare, and the staccato portions of Emily Dickinson.

265
00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:09.540
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Which code poetics steeped in digitally drenched communication so Basically, this is what she's trying to do merge code work and different forms of code work and human languages and and.

266
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.150
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Later in other of her.

267
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:16.200
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: works in particular actually sorry to interrupt you just.

268
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:27.750

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.210
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: The big.

271
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.080
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: I don't understand your your what what you don't have.

272
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:47.820
GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: We don't you, we have all your slides, you have to to to to to to push the presenter theon and.

GIOVANNA Di ROSARIO: Yes, you will go.

275
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:52.200
Okay.

276
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.900
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Well, actually I didn't forget but it's easier to me to fall off track of what's coming.

277
00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.370
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: But it's no problem I just I just improvise.

278
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:17.190
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Okay, so Okay, so the poem and it's the anthropocene entrepreneur Center was published in the New York in the network or live Journal and it's an example of make a messenger with.

279
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:29.970
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: bracketing Okay, so when a we don't have enough time to explore it and you have it here below and basically it.

280
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:42.330
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: It talks about the effects of anthropocene and and the term a refers, as you all know, to you the geological time when humanity is coming.

281
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:52.650
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And a huge impact on on the environment, it was a term that was coined by chemist Paul Kristen and marine biologist eugene stormer.

282
00:48:53.010 --> 00:49:03.600
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And and and it also emphasizes do a certain stand not just human impact on the planet but also encounters with non human agents and.

283
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:21.240
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: With regards to the from the semiotic point of view, the kind of interactions and interactions that are core between organisms and their environments, so this is all highlighted in in this point which I not going to explore and and.

284
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:39.450
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And, just to clarify that the category of the nonhuman includes biological forums like animal plans microorganisms or whatever, but also non biological entities such as machines or artificial intelligence and you have, and you will see that my slide also are.

285
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.180
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Providing pictures of.

286
00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:46.110
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: V versus you know, for example, in this case.

287
00:49:47.700 --> 00:50:01.950
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: The author is her mets risk herself and it's it's to face rather face victim hoarder and so, when what is she doing, and in these V vs.

288
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:16.410
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: she's a linking humans, animals in animate objects and the poems I like metamorphic and and and we have all the time, like the anthropocene as a scene, you know, and this is also emphasized.

289
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:28.950
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In in the in the point that I mentioned the anthropocene if you've noticed the the term how she plays with the scenery the scene everything that's visualize not.

290
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:41.250
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And as a as a performative playable as scenario beyond the human non she see insisting this scenic dimensions and this force is also an inquiry into the post ontology.

291
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:54.780
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: of knowledge and cognition related to the acquisition of alphabetic language in the case of the messenger because she's breaking alphabetic language and this disruption of the reading experience.

292
00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:05.640
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Which in the verses she achieves because you can click on the different numbers and read and not just in in one line format, but in.

293
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:25.530
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Different for a lines like hypertext, obviously, and this also poses epistemological questions in inquiring to the notion of interpretation and explanation and how many and if meaning is only uni vocal or is it multi vocal know and so.

294
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:31.590
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: When she explains, where she got the idea for a messenger and.

295
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:41.790
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: She mentioned in this interview for a soma in 2016 and she mentioned that she wants to a.

296
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.980
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Sorry, I just.

297
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:58.410
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: click on there Okay, she wants to open up boy take aspects okay and create a kind of dimensional interplay combining the lyrical and like formalized structures of code Okay, and he uses.

298
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:10.320
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In in the under percent point, for example, she uses bracketing and this bracketing functions like semiotic cues that invite that verse means if they break the word and.

299
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:24.120
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: They multiply the meanings and and she also mentioned that this idea originated in from a horizontal creations of the work by V and matrix matrix.

300
00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:31.410
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And and they're mixing of game aesthetics, and our feminism and the tool online engagement, so you know that this.

301
00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:44.670
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: vm matrix was one of the first cyber feminist groups and they very strong and gender approach, which of course matches our panel today gender in bits.

302
00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:58.380
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And, and here is, for example, the verse 11 power barking and the author is herself and and she uses messenger bracketing the words and and multiplying.

303
00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:12.930
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: The meanings, and these are other example because many verses are address to the western a women and women power, this one is her Raven flip by Andrea Phillips and and brace yourself.

304
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:30.210
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And this one is a number 10 artemisia known by Anna nature, and you can see, the images also how she's questioning gender stereotypes and also fusion human image with animal like.

305
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:46.020
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: entities and also all other kinds of objects and non human in general, and this one is a number 12 bridal day by Ria myers and this one is basement by.

306
00:53:46.500 --> 00:54:00.030
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Scott redbird and again playing with them metal objects female characteristics and and this ambiguity of between the human and non human.

307
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:13.470
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And and and I in this slide I just point out that this the mechanisms, she uses are similar to what victor's lawsky in art as technique.

308
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:22.650
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And a label they familiarization, if you remember, and the purpose was to remove the automatism of perception and cognition.

309
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:33.750
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And to raise cognitive awareness of how knowledge is produced by means of language now, it was a technique that was using early 20th century.

310
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:47.520
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: modernism in art and later in data and culture jamming and it's also in a way, related to Sigmund freud's notion of the uncanny, which of course emerges in many of her V vs.

311
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:58.200
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Okay, so a little bit about God work and how it works and and a you know it seems to me also that.

312
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:07.890
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Court would the way she introduces court work and it's reminiscent of a reminiscent of other techniques used to subvert power structures.

313
00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:17.790
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In alphabetic language and and examples are Lewis Carroll James Joyce William burroughs and, in particular, like.

314
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:29.880
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In the electronic revolution and borrows uses the metaphor of language as a virus, and that is spread by means of institutionalization and a demonic structures.

315
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:40.110
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And the the idea behind borrows cut up was to actually break these kind of order of things in focus words no so when.

316
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:51.240
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: almost like a messenger is almost like an inoculation have a small portion of pharma con in in terms of dairy died, you know which is both a vaccine or an antidote.

317
00:55:51.510 --> 00:56:00.090
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: But also poison not that incorporates political antigens in order to subvert the infection of power so.

318
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:09.300
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And we have a couple of quotations there from siminoff ski and also from junkie Lee who have actually talked about how the digital arts.

319
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:21.540
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And do have a grammar of Polish and there is a politics of code behind the use of code work and other programming structures in electronic literature on that art.

320
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:35.580
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And so, when, as I said, her point seem to produce a kind of virus like infection at various levels, and they mobilize poor yeses and the aesthetic the ontological and epistemological.

321
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.950
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And in her poems the humans meet non human agents and there are these kind of interactions that I was talking about.

322
00:56:44.370 --> 00:57:01.440
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: and which are signal by markup language or in the case of the V vs by you know the numbers that you click and you can organize in the reading and structure that you prefer, and so this indicates this realize that.

323
00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:11.640
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Nothing is free XX that everything is a product of the actions of the agents doing performing and there's semiotic interchange.

324
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:25.410
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And and, and this is a kind of a sort multiple sort of multiverse process ontology know and we have a quotation there from and a Bruno latour who is one of the participants or in.

325
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.970
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In.

326
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:33.450
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: In material terry's and and and he says that this Angela.

327
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:42.720
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Angela for morphic expressions must be taken not figuratively by literally really a matter of defining the human enterprise forum.

328
00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:53.130
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And more first of a non human and deciding on the limits of the freedom lottery is one of the first who begins to explore and the impact of artefacts in our life.

329
00:57:53.490 --> 00:58:07.500
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: A technological machines and so on, now and we have here a lovely picture of V verse one and by Mark Marino, and so, when a.

330
00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:25.200
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: I don't i'm trying to go fast, because I don't I don't even realize how much time I have left, but anyway, she caused these story boxes and I was inspired by the idea of the pandora's box of course they in Greek mythology you open the JAR and all kinds of.

331
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:40.770
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: horrible things are liberated these spirits and they create great suffering and the stress for humans, but basically like the metaphor, that I was using before the virus, you know she her work is like a virus.

332
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:49.890
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: or a pandora's box that you know, makes us realize, you know it makes us come to terms with the things that need to be changed or that.

333
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:55.530
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Are we are not aware of it creates this.

334
00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:06.210
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: idea of estrangement know and and one key aspect also indicates of Pandora books that has to do with gender aspects.

335
00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:14.340
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Of course, is also the question of the responsibility, because, also in the pandora's story as an evil story in the biblical.

336
00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:24.780
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: story and it's always a woman who is to blame for not taking responsibility for failing to do something no so the whole thing is.

337
00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:30.450
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: I interpret her versus as a relocation of the blame and responsibility.

338
00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:42.870
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: And to the reader user you know, to make the reader user become engaged in global problems that we have today and, of course, you can see, for example, this one by Michael Mike wire, you know where the.

339
00:59:43.470 --> 01:00:07.530
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: Economic griffey the images are and a resembling not just artificially intelligent robots but also by organisms, like the cell know, so there is this fusion metamorphic fusion in all four works, and this is car by Jeremy hide and again and, just to mention that the.

340
01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:21.690
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: there's this can be manipulated and reconfigure the on not just the sequence, but also, you can scale, you can rotate you consuming so this opens and different fractal levels of.

341
01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:32.910
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: recombination not just with words but also with the way you can manipulate the verses, and so this one, for example, a curve I use this.

342
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:51.120
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: image because i'm talking about this zooming in zooming out, but you also have that this one for me elation and where you get the same feeling of a how a you can manipulate this works in order to to.

343
01:00:52.290 --> 01:01:01.470
ASUN LOPEZ-VARELA AZCARATE: make me come to awareness of particular aspects of the relationship between the human and non human and also a.

344
01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.760
