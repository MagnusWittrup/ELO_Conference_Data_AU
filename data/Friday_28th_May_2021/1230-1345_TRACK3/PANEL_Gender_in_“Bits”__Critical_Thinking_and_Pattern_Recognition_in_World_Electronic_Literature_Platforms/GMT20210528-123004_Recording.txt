01:23:11	Andréa Catrópa:	I have two questions for Nohelia. The influence of concrete poetry in contemporary Brazilian poetry (print or digital), has remained strong for many decades. 1) Do you notice a decrease in the influence of concrete poetry in Brazilian digital literature? 2) If so, could this be related to an increase in female production in the area?
