00:18:18	Dene Grigar:	The agreement usually goes for 5 years
00:18:50	Mark Sample (he/him):	Dene, how much (ballpark figure) of a financial commitment is it for the institution?

00:19:05	Dene Grigar:	WSUV is giving $12,5 each yaer
00:19:22	Dene Grigar:	MITH gave $6K and a 1/2 time office admin
00:19:36	Jeremy Hight:	hey there I am
00:19:37	Brian Kelly:	It would also be good to have "mini proposals" for conference organizations--such as "our group will take care of workshops," or :"our group will help newcomers and promote ELO to other groups"
00:19:38	Dene Grigar:	Holly is paid for by my university
00:19:39	Caitlin Fisher:	York is interested.

00:21:49	Brian Kelly:	Hooray for REVerb! We will showcase REverb August 10 at 11 m EST on Second Tuesday Salons!
00:21:55	Caitlin Fisher:	Although I think we’ve shown over the past while that administration needn’t be connected to ELO exec institutional affiliations
00:21:57	Brian Kelly:	I'll rename
00:22:14	Katie Schaag:	v. cool Dene!

00:23:20	Vinícius UFMT:	Such great projects!!!!
00:23:45	Dene Grigar:	Yes, the ELCs has been a boon for the field
00:24:27	Vinícius UFMT:	And an inspiration for other anthologies all around the world
00:24:38	Dene Grigar:	+1
00:25:12	Dene Grigar:	Sean is working on The Digital Review with Will Luers
00:26:22	Deena Larsen:	Excellent outreach at MLA!!
00:26:38	Deena Larsen:	Ooohhh… where do we buy the T shirts?
00:29:17	Anna Gorin Nacher:	great to see a young scholar from Poland, Paulina Chorzewska at MLA - she got in touch and next year I’m inviting her to a doctoral seminar I’m leading
00:29:39	Samya Roy:	Congratulations to everyone involved here! Huge respect to everyone.
00:29:54	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	We are thrilled with the proposals we got for MLA! It’ll be good to be having those e-lit conversations there
00:29:59	Dene Grigar:	Much needed
00:31:40	Dene Grigar:	Hi Tina, did you see your work in the afterflash exhibition?
00:32:22	Søren Bro Pold:	So much great work!
00:32:23	Anastasia Salter:	Ah, just like Zoom teaching!
00:32:56	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	LOL @Anastasia
00:33:10	Katie Schaag:	Thanks everyone!!
00:33:12	Søren Bro Pold:	Thanks!
00:33:14	Scott Rettberg:	Deena has her hand up
00:33:14	Tina Escaja:	Not yet! Thanks so much, Dene :)
00:33:34	Dene Grigar:	Let me know if you see any errirs
00:33:36	Dene Grigar:	errors
00:33:40	Deena Larsen:	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cC0wmujJW5C-mz-TD3OjPX7hMsq6X20VMGI78ji-0ic/edit
00:35:13	Dene Grigar:	+1 deena
00:35:56	Deena Larsen:	Inclusion solutions --have a lot of great ideas for initiatives
00:36:09	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	We are just silently holding each other. I think it’s nice
00:36:28	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	Oh here he goes…
00:36:30	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	hahaha
00:37:02	Deena Larsen:	to sign up for second Tuesdays 11 am ET email deenaforcedtouse@gmail.com
00:37:11	Deena Larsen:	And we have first Fridays on Discord
00:37:15	Anna Gorin Nacher:	yes, sitting in silence with a group of people is just demonstrating what a great community it is
00:37:33	Deena Larsen:	And we need to do a calendar of all the online events--@Mark Merino--can you say where that calendar is?
00:38:16	Alan Sondheim:	We absolutely need to have both online and offllne; too many people including myself can't travel that easily and are not institutionally affiliated. It's imperative to have a deep virtual component.
00:38:42	Alan Sondheim:	Institutions have a LOT more resources than we do!!!
00:38:53	Deena Larsen:	We do need to figure out a delicate balance of inviting artists and conferences, but to also ensure that everyone is included.
00:40:05	Søren Bro Pold:	It wouldn’t have been possible to host a conference that is both online and virtual in Aarhus. We don’t have the means. At least we need to find other means.
00:40:32	Deena Larsen:	Yes, I think we could have an "online conference organizer" and an in-person one... but this may also be difficult.
00:40:40	Søren Bro Pold:	Even though I also believe that we should find ways to avoid too much travel.
00:40:47	Marjorie Luesebrink:	thanks to all the organizers
00:40:50	Deena Larsen:	Perhaps we could have online events the week before or the week after a physical conference?
00:41:31	Alan Sondheim:	It's not that many means; I've been organizing highschool reunions for people all over the country  - from a local school. Not all people can travel and the levels between institutional contributors and others is enormous.
00:41:33	Marjorie Luesebrink:	good work Rui and committee
00:41:52	Deena Larsen:	DOing a physical conference and online, you have to have good internet
00:42:09	Alan Sondheim:	A camera team can literally just be a GoPro -
00:42:11	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	As Leo would say, these are just best practices, RE: conference guidelines
00:43:30	Mark Sample (he/him):	We should pin the URL to the ELO calendar onto a Discord channel
00:43:45	Deena Larsen:	I agree Mark Sample!
00:44:50	Jeremy Hight:	my new book comes out later this year...each story has a specific cover...one by mez    more info later
00:44:54	Deena Larsen:	SEcond Tuesday Salon schedule:June 8: Playable Comms (Lyle Skains)July 13: Metadata and nuts and bolts ELO Repository August 10: (RE)VERB Andrew Demirjian Sept 14: Salon Salon Katie Oct 12: Sharing stories privately

00:45:30	Deena Larsen:	Can everyone also announce their works in progress (e.g. Asstrid)
00:46:06	Astrid Ensslin (she/her):	You mean the Eastgate book, Deena? ;-)
00:46:14	Mark Marino:	laos
00:46:20	Deena Larsen:	Yes, the one on the Eastgate Quarterly Review
00:46:32	Deena Larsen:	everyone has so many amazing projects!

00:47:47	Caitlin Fisher:	Hi Carlota! Great to meet you!
00:47:51	Deena Larsen:	nominations would be great... and it will need to be ok for nominees to politely decline due to other commitments.
00:48:03	Carlota Salvador Megias:	thank you for the warm welcome!
00:48:07	Erik Loyer:	Hi Samya!
00:48:10	John McDaid:	Hi, Samya — congrats
00:48:11	Deena Larsen:	We also have the Literary Advisory Board, and we can ask them to take particular actions which would fit into their commitments
00:48:18	Tina Escaja:	About ongoing projects, thanks, Deena, here is my ongoing project on Covid-19. It includes art installations, testimonies, generative poemtry, and even a CAPTCHA poem!!!: https://proyecto.w3.uvm.edu/do-over/mary/maryvirus/together.html
00:48:24	Anna Gorin Nacher:	Very excited about your presentation, @Samya! Would love to know more about Indian e-lit

00:48:34	Rob Wittig:	Welcome, Samya! Nice to meet you! Sounds like a great dissertation!
00:48:50	Jeremy Hight:	samya is awesome
00:49:05	Søren Bro Pold:	Yes welcome Samya! Great to see you!
00:49:09	Alan Sondheim:	The Literary Advisory Board (which I'm on) seems to be dead; I haven't had any communication in years and have no idea how we might propose anything to anyone -
00:49:25	Astrid Ensslin (she/her):	@all: we have another DHSI course sponsored by the ELO kicking off in 2 weeks' time. Some of the people in this room are on the classlist. Welcome to the ELO, Samya! :-)
00:49:26	Anna Gorin Nacher:	@Alan, we’re working on that
00:49:32	Samya Roy:	Congratulations Jeremy and Deena and everyone else for their stellar work!
00:49:33	Lai-Tze Fan:	Congrats to Samya for just submitting his MA thesis!
00:49:35	Anna Gorin Nacher:	you’ll soon get some news
00:49:48	Scott Rettberg:	I know that Joe Tabbi is looking to re-activate the LAB
00:49:56	Deena Larsen:	We do need a liaison between the LAB and the ELO board
00:50:21	Anna Gorin Nacher:	yes, there’s a bunch of us Board members working on LAB reactivation
00:50:33	Caitlin Fisher:	@denna - agreed! And Joe Tabbi is now taking that on!
00:50:39	Anna Gorin Nacher:	@Deena, it’s all coming very soon
00:50:40	Samya Roy:	Thank you so much everyone for your appreciation! The ELO community has been extremely helpful. Specially the website! I remember going through the profiles of most of the folks here trying to understand the range of works that has been done in the field.
00:50:42	Alan Sondheim:	I think the LAB should have a number of members who are not institutionally-affiliated... --
00:51:11	Mark Marino:	https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_8lodpjqincebvp9v8m6hr1ecqc%40group.calendar.google.com
00:51:17	Deena Larsen:	ELO is a labor of love and the board should be congratulated for all they do.
00:51:44	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	“There’s no perks” Stephanie!!!! <3 <3
00:51:58	Caitlin Fisher:	Hanging out with Stephanie is a perk!
00:52:09	Christine Wilks:	Is it possible to have non-affiliated board members, to include people outside universities?
00:52:09	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	Agreed deeply
00:52:10	Deena Larsen:	Maybe we should have a "to do" list posted on eliterature.org?
00:52:15	Deena Larsen:	Or a good way to volunteer?
00:52:17	Mark Marino:	i am always looking for volunteers to help with  communications
00:52:22	Deena Larsen:	for specific projects
00:52:42	Erik:	not true - free Super Mario backgrounds - definite sign of bureaucratic hierarchy
00:53:04	Deena Larsen:	Christine, yes, including non-university folks is critical to bridging communities.
00:53:08	Alex Saum-Pascual (she/her):	@Erik LOL
00:53:27	Christine Wilks:	Thanks Deena, that's good to know
00:53:40	Samya Roy:	Yes. It is because of spaces like ELO, DHARTI and Game Studies India that I was able to launch the first research and creative organisation on Indian Electronic Literature! We had almost 100 members in a week! In Twitter @ELitIndia
00:54:02	Scott Rettberg:	Awesome, Samya!
00:54:10	Rob Wittig:	Samya, that is great!

Even though this is the first time for me at ELO conference, I have known about the organization for a while. Many of you are familiar names from various lists from many years ago and from your work as well, so it is great to share this space with you here. I am a researcher and curator and in my work I explore relational arrangements of humans and nonhumans and their biopolitical creations through posthuman curating and curating in/as common/s, future thinking, affective data and data fictions.
01:01:48	Samya Roy:	Deena's WritePods have been amazing. I had soooo much FUN!
