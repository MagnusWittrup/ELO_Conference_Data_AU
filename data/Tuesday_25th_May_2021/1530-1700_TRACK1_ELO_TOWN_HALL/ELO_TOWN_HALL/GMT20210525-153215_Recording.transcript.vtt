00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:19.290
Caitlin Fisher: The organizing teams i've been sort of more peripherally involved, but there's so much work that has gone into the conference I almost I can't even really start to name start with with with soren and Scott, but.

128
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:25.800
Caitlin Fisher: There are so many you know Jason was working like right up to like dead time and all these incredible posters.

129
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.800
Caitlin Fisher: eight different exhibitions.

130
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:39.450
Caitlin Fisher: Anyway, it's just been a fantastic Labor and I know that there'll be a more full some opportunity for thank us later on, at the opening, but I wanted to begin by acknowledging that to you.

131
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.080
Caitlin Fisher: So thanks on behalf of the elo for everybody who took part in organizing the conference space we're in right now.

132
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:54.780
Caitlin Fisher: Just like zoom teaching, no, no Anastasia most many people have their cameras on so it's not exactly like losing teaching.

133
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.670
Caitlin Fisher: should have like all cameras off and one person in bed.

134
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.340
Caitlin Fisher: Oh dina has her hand up dina over to you.

135
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.600
Deena Larsen: And I apologize my private computer is the only one in the world without a webcam.

136
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:19.260
Deena Larsen: The others are government computers so forgive me, but I did want to, and I will put it in the chat.

137
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:30.390
Deena Larsen: say thank you guys so much for all of your initiatives as well on the code of conduct that you've been doing and finding ways to include people, this has been.

138
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:44.700
Deena Larsen: so important for people with handicap access around the world financial issues as well, so thank you for that the second Tuesday salon had an incredibly active.

139
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.330
Deena Larsen: brainstorming session and I put it into the chat.

140
00:21:49.440 --> 00:22:08.880
Deena Larsen: For inclusion solutions, and I know the Board is meeting on these, and I hope that that initiative continues and that we can continue to reach out to people, I also wanted to say, personally, I know that the pandemics, been very difficult, but having an online.

141
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:28.890
Deena Larsen: component has been lifesaving extremely important Thank you guys so much for this and even we can meet in person, I do hope that we're planning on at least some online, and the second Tuesday salons every second Tuesday.

142
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.070
Deena Larsen: 11am Eastern standard time.

143
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:41.880
Deena Larsen: anybody's willing ready to join, we do have that going on for distance and accessibility it's been very fun.

144
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.050
Deena Larsen: Thank you guys so much and shout out for doing what you do for inclusive.

145
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.140
Caitlin Fisher: Thanks so much for that comment and also for your your leadership.

146
00:22:55.170 --> 00:23:05.670
Caitlin Fisher: You did amazing leadership around the Salon and also for pushing us to to to do better work all the time and just for being such an incredible member of the yellow community.

147
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:20.910
Caitlin Fisher: Other thoughts, this is also a chance for you to you don't have to comment on any initiatives here just sort of like where you're at and ideas that the board can take back and think about as well and.

148
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.660
Caitlin Fisher: Also initiatives you might like to see.

149
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.180
Scott Rettberg: i'm just enjoying watching everyone be silent together.

150
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.830
Caitlin Fisher: it's our new meditative space it.

151
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:47.370
Caitlin Fisher: Below where you just have time to refresh where you could book off of meetings at work just come here and do nothing.

152
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.400
So Scott.

153
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:53.430
Anna Gorin Nacher: I think.

154
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.290
Caitlin Fisher: it's true.

155
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.430
Caitlin Fisher: it's actually it's quite.

156
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.850
Nice.

157
00:23:59.580 --> 00:23:59.730
If.

158
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.090
Scott Rettberg: I could make one one suggestion that i've.

159
00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:13.680
Scott Rettberg: That i've mentioned to a couple of board members already which is simply that I would the the part of the the Code of Conduct dealing with the conferences.

160
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:26.790
Scott Rettberg: I would consider putting that into a separate document and then evaluating it from the standpoint of potential future conference organizers.

161
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:40.620
Scott Rettberg: As well just because there's a couple of potential issues there one, is that although it's great to have both online and in person conferences.

162
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.110
Scott Rettberg: or they can be both.

163
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:55.560
Scott Rettberg: it's it can be a challenging thing for conference organizers to to actually be challenged to do both of those things at the same time.

164
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:13.140
Scott Rettberg: And that can also be it, although it sounds like its inclusion airy that can also be exclusionary in the sense that there's a lot of institutions that would not be able to pull together the resources to do that.

165
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:29.550
Scott Rettberg: And then the other aspect of that that I that I would really consider is, although of course we want to make sure that we adhere to best practices and and human rights and equality.

166
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:43.020
Scott Rettberg: Is that if we restrict ourselves if we say to to artists and to institutions that we can't organize conferences in any country where.

167
00:25:43.920 --> 00:26:07.620
Scott Rettberg: Any of these principles are being violated that's also going to say to you know, to the artists and to the academics in countries where where these things are not adhere to certainly norway's in a great position with this, but many other countries are not, for example, last year.

168
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:21.840
Scott Rettberg: I think that the trump administration would have been in violation of many of those principles in the US, and that would have meant that last year's conference could not have been held in Orlando.

169
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:31.740
Scott Rettberg: So there's a lot of these sort of details that I think we can sort of rush to to these sorts of things and say that sounds like a great idea.

170
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:39.060
Scott Rettberg: But I would encourage you to think those through carefully and then to consider separating those two documents.

171
00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:46.620
Scott Rettberg: So that one might be guidelines for conference organization or These are the things we would love to see.

172
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:55.920
Scott Rettberg: In future conferences and then the other via via code of conduct, and then the last thing that I would say about that is that I.

173
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:06.840
Scott Rettberg: Think as an organization and i'm so glad that so many people stepped up from the yellow board, you know it's especially single caitlin and mark Marino.

174
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:18.990
Scott Rettberg: For and and also other people Eric lawyer and Claudia who who kind of came in and helped us out with a lot of stuff with the conference, but I think in that statement of those guidelines.

175
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:30.270
Scott Rettberg: The ila should also articulate what its role will be because right now, it says future conference organizers will be required to do this, and this, and this.

176
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:38.670
Scott Rettberg: And just reading it from the perspective of someone if you want them to come in and organize a conference and what the first thing you do is give them.

177
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:48.540
Scott Rettberg: A code of conduct that has, at the very bottom of it, these are conference guidelines preceded by don't violate human rights, and all these ways.

178
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.850
Scott Rettberg: I think you're going to pose some.

179
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:51.810
Caitlin Fisher: challenges.

180
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.980
Scott Rettberg: To the organization.

181
00:27:53.370 --> 00:28:08.370
Scott Rettberg: In the future, so I just wanted to you know, to put that out there, I know that it's a it's a great initiative, and I know that these things are often living documents, but I would actually encourage you to think carefully about revising that document.

182
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:18.660
Caitlin Fisher: Thank you very much for that comment Scott, will take that back to the board for consideration, I think a lot of our Members are here right now.

183
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:36.570
Caitlin Fisher: Other points either related to that issue or two other things that are on your mind either in response to our current initiatives or two initiatives that you'd like to see there's quite a bit of discussion in the chat now about.

184
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:46.620
Caitlin Fisher: The value of remote conferences minimizing travel potentially finding other ways to have some online event.

185
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:54.510
Caitlin Fisher: So I think that there's a lot of creativity, we could bring to finding the right, the right balance here.

186
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.080
Caitlin Fisher: Sorry.

187
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.500
S?ren Bro Pold: yeah I just want to add into to what what what Scott said.

188
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:16.740
S?ren Bro Pold: By saying basically we wouldn't have been able to to make both an online and and and and a physical conference that that would have been impossible it's quite.

189
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:26.970
S?ren Bro Pold: Well, actually doing a virtual conference is easier when it is virtual because you all have have your own cameras, you know if you do a physical conference, you have to have a camera team.

190
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:48.180
S?ren Bro Pold: Which is you know, a whole lot of other costs, all we should think about other ways of being together because i'm totally for finding ways that where we don't have to travel around the world, once a year, also for climate reasons, obviously, but also to be inclusive.

191
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.560
Caitlin Fisher: Thanks very much.

192
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:57.540
Caitlin Fisher: We have dina has her hand up again, or is this from last time.

193
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:14.640
Deena Larsen: No, this is another one, but also mark Marino has been developing a wonderful calendar that I can't access and there's so many online events and so many in person events mark, can you explain how that calendar works.

194
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.790
Mark Marino: Sure sure Dana well, like all of our communications.

195
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:38.610
Mark Marino: We again, it may lead to a little bit of a bottleneck but we'd prefer for Members just to got events just send them my way i'll put them up on the calendar i'm happy to do that just the same way I forward events and announcements to our email yellow lister.

196
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.470
Mark Marino: But.

197
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.480
Mark Marino: If it.

198
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.730
Mark Marino: If it makes it with that.

199
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.920
Deena Larsen: Where is that calendar.

200
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.120
Mark Marino: where's the what's the URL you mean or where you are.

201
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:51.480
Yes.

202
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.340
Deena Larsen: Can you share the URL for that calendar in the chat at least thanks I will.

203
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:03.630
Mark Marino: yeah i'll put it so So the question was was you can't find the yellow calendar i'm sorry I thought it was about posted to the yellow calm right.

204
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:08.670
Deena Larsen: Well, one I can't find it into How do people get events on the calendar.

205
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.750
Mark Marino: yeah so.

206
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:18.960
Mark Marino: I will post, the link to the capitalism ones there faster for me i'll put the link to the calendar in the discord chat.

207
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:25.200
Mark Marino: And mark sample has a great suggestion that i'll let him talk about in a second if he wants to, and then.

208
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.190
Mark Marino: And then, if you have any announcements of any events whatsoever just send an email.

209
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:44.010
Caitlin Fisher: And for anybody here you've got a really captive audience that encouraged everybody put your announcements in the chat right now, and following this conference, who will try to.

210
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:52.410
Caitlin Fisher: follow in support your events and initiatives I also really encourage anybody who, especially if this is your first yellow to introduce yourself in the chat.

211
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.810
Caitlin Fisher: I know not everybody wants to.

212
00:31:54.810 --> 00:32:01.890
Caitlin Fisher: speak up at a town hall but we'd love to know who you are and to make an effort to to connect with you over the course of the next couple of days.

213
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.620
Caitlin Fisher: Yes, and absolutely check out the discord channel, I think.

214
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:21.900
Caitlin Fisher: marks done an amazing job, I think it was set up by laughs games last year marks continuing it at the moment it's very vibrant it tests of ebbs and flows, but we're hoping to be able to to see a lot of view on discord.

215
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:39.000
Caitlin Fisher: Other questions, this is a very peaceful town hall we're all very Zen here oh JEREMY has a new book coming out later this year fantastic dina's announcing the salons.

216
00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.550
Caitlin Fisher: Congratulations, Jeremy congrats Tina.

217
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.150
Scott Rettberg: Does everybody have their presentations done.

218
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.580
Mark Sample (he/him): I just raised, my hand, I guess, I don't need to because it's so silent.

219
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:31.680
Mark Sample (he/him): I have a question I kind of from a board member to the people who are on the board here, but just to everybody in Community Leo said earlier that.

220
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.940
Mark Sample (he/him): You know we're thinking about different ways to.

221
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:44.580
Mark Sample (he/him): Change who sits on the board of directors so so right now basically the Board of Directors new members are are basically.

222
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.700
Mark Sample (he/him): kind of vetted by current board of directors and there's there's a vote.

223
00:33:51.540 --> 00:34:02.640
Mark Sample (he/him): But there's been discussion among some board members about like maybe opening this up somehow so i'm just curious while we're while we're all here if if folks have other ideas or thoughts about.

224
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:13.800
Mark Sample (he/him): How members to the board of directors are at least some Members, maybe not entirely the entire slate but some members of the board of directors might be kind of coming from the Community.

225
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:16.770
Mark Sample (he/him): anything like that and.

226
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.380
Mark Sample (he/him): You know any thoughts.

227
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.460
Mark Sample (he/him): Or is it working just fine right now.

228
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:47.670
Scott Rettberg: Oh one thought I know what some organizations do is that they when they have you know separate board of directors in the in the corporate structure that that the yellow has as a five on three nonprofit organization.

229
00:34:48.810 --> 00:35:01.500
Scott Rettberg: I know that what some organized organizations do would be to have some slots on the board that are nominated by by the organization's general membership.

230
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:17.250
Scott Rettberg: And then still approved by the Board of Directors and I think in the case of the yellow i'm familiar with the bylaws of the yellow because I wrote with a lawyer, a long time ago, but.

231
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:33.750
Scott Rettberg: But that would still be within the current bylaws of the of the yellow, for example, to have Members at large that are nominated by the hilo community and then sort of simply approved by the board of directors.

232
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:43.590
Mark Sample (he/him): yeah that's great Scott that ideas come up before, and one thing I want to kind of point out, I guess, some of us know and some of us don't and I don't even know.

233
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.480
Mark Sample (he/him): The entire entirety of the legal ramifications, but you know we are.

234
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:58.260
Mark Sample (he/him): A legal entity with legal status, so there are certain things we can do, and certain things we can't do without involving lawyers when it comes to changing our bylaws or operating.

235
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:09.360
Mark Sample (he/him): So that's something, just in case anybody's thinking why don't you just kind of wave your hand and start doing something differently, sometimes they're kind of legal reasons that we cannot just change the way we operate.

236
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:24.000
Caitlin Fisher: This is a great discussion to have also point out to that most board members have been active members of the community it's not like we draw from somehow mysteriously outside of our membership, most people nominated have been.

237
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.070
Caitlin Fisher: You know, within the the folds of the yellow and and are nominated that way, but I think this is.

238
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:29.760
Caitlin Fisher: Something that.

239
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.920
Caitlin Fisher: it's good to have a lot of number of options and ways of working to make that feel like like the process is not so opaque.

240
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:44.700
Caitlin Fisher: And so we'll definitely be considering this, I just want I see your hand any you'll be next, I just want to shout out some of the things in the chat.

241
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:55.470
Caitlin Fisher: We have oh it's all come up there's so many things that are happening someone just finished their thesis some yes here from India first time at elo so check the chat there, thank you, Nice to meet you.

242
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:04.350
Caitlin Fisher: roberta's thesis on Italian electronic literature's coming in November 2021 so congratulations for that and carlotta.

243
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:14.100
Caitlin Fisher: Is is new and has been helping out behind the scenes, with the conference fantastic and someone else's mentioned the law of the literary Advisory Board.

244
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:21.330
Caitlin Fisher: And that's also a fantastic way where people can be making contributions from our Community.

245
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:35.940
Caitlin Fisher: it's been relatively inactive, for the last little while, but we have plans for activating it and all of the you know the incredible resource that we have out there, so Danny then stephanie I said.

246
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:45.330
Dene Grigar: Now one thing i'll say about board I joined in 2006 and it takes a lot of time, so one of the things to think about if you're interested in being on the board.

247
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:52.800
Dene Grigar: Is the amount of time commitment, it takes if you're going up for tenure if you're trying to finish a dissertation, this is not the time to be on the board.

248
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:59.220
Dene Grigar: But certainly we want people that are very active in the Community that want to contribute their time energy.

249
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:06.600
Dene Grigar: All of us one thing you'll you'll also learn is that we, we do not take money from the yellow so board members are not paid.

250
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:22.830
Dene Grigar: To do any of the work we do we're all volunteers, so we fly to a conference, and we do something it's usually it's always out of our own expenses, so it does take a little bit of energy and time commitment to be on the board, but certainly we welcome anyone who's interested.

251
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.040
Caitlin Fisher: Thank you stephanie.

252
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:44.100
Stephanie Strickland: Yes, I was gonna say along the same lines that it's a working bored not an advisory board nobody just advisors and the amount of work is very much you can always tell we've had an extremely busy spring.

253
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:50.430
Stephanie Strickland: And the amount of hours for consulting that was required, we also pay for our own.

254
00:38:51.210 --> 00:39:01.050
Stephanie Strickland: to belong to the yellow and to pay conference tooth so there's no purpose for being on board, other than wonderful company by people who really care.

255
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:11.790
Stephanie Strickland: about the field, and you know really do their best and we anyone who, who is interested to that degree we'd love to hear from you, and if you would like to be part.

256
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:21.180
Stephanie Strickland: Of the literary Advisory Board and with there's a number of things, we would like such people to do a Joe would like people to write descriptions for the.

257
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:30.540
Stephanie Strickland: yield descriptions of Isla works of which there's you know so many that we'd like to learn more about and have described to become part of.

258
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:39.660
Stephanie Strickland: literature, where they can be studied by other people, but other things too, I mean we have places to show installations of work into.

259
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:53.640
Stephanie Strickland: Post conference many, many things that would be wonderful, so please, and you know caitlyn if people do want to express an interest is that is there some should they be writing mark, I mean.

260
00:39:54.570 --> 00:40:00.660
Stephanie Strickland: what's the way to express it what's a direct way for someone to express an interest that they might have.

261
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:15.120
Caitlin Fisher: I don't think we have one formal mechanism, I would invite anybody here if you're seriously considering that you would like to be more active or be involved in yellow leadership or in the literary Advisory Board in some way to contact any of the.

262
00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:24.870
Caitlin Fisher: board members who are here and we can be you know we can work on getting back to you, and if it's not an immediate action item if it's sort of like.

263
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:41.070
Caitlin Fisher: You know, interested in being put forward at some other time, we might not immediately get back to you, but we will keep that reading list, I think it would be amazing to find out who's interested in doing this work because we're constantly seeking renewal mark give a better maybe.

264
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.720
Mark Marino: Everyone contact, no, no, I don't.

265
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:42.810
know.

266
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.290
Mark Marino: I don't have a better answer, they can contact anyone on the board.

267
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.530
Mark Marino: No, I I wanted to say a couple things The first one is.

268
00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:58.560
Mark Marino: Again this this thanks to our organizers and congratulations on putting together a fantastic Conference, I mean this is.

269
00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:06.600
Mark Marino: i've been attending conferences, for over 25 years, and this is the most extraordinary one i've ever been a part of where there are eight.

270
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:25.950
Mark Marino: eight International art exhibitions there are multiple continents that are actually hosting events for this conference, and there are over 200 people in attendance is just extraordinary to me, I have not seen anything like this ever The second thing I want to say is, if you have an event.

271
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.230
Mark Marino: that you would like elo to be a Co sponsor of we have a mechanism for you to request our sponsorship.

272
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:43.140
Mark Marino: Now, sometimes that sponsorship comes in the form of my job just communication, so will help amplify you will put it out on all of our channels will get people.

273
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.760
Mark Marino: To in their zoo seats are in there in person sees if we can help in any way with that.

274
00:41:48.690 --> 00:42:04.110
Mark Marino: So that's one thing we can do, and then also another thing that we we support our grant application, we can be a sponsoring organization for a coat you know, one of the the oversight I don't know it's officially called on your grant so we have a mechanism for that.

275
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.570
Mark Marino: And again so and I guess, I want to put this in the context of my previous answer, which is.

276
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.460
Mark Marino: You know, one of the things, one of the reasons we don't just make the calendar.

277
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:22.710
Mark Marino: Open access or we don't make the listserv open access is so that when you have something that you want to get out to membership.

278
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:35.160
Mark Marino: It helps us to have a little bit of a heads up about it so, then we can help amplify in through appropriate channels and really try to organize our membership around that, so there are lots of ways elo can support you.

279
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:51.000
Mark Marino: Even with your very, very local events or even something that you might think is of a smaller order, we can help be because sponsors of those because we're trying to yellows is maybe a lot more decentralized than you might think.

280
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:52.920
Okay, thanks.

281
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:59.970
Caitlin Fisher: that's such an excellent point mark The other thing i'll say is I remember you know kind of as an emerging scholar encountering those.

282
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:09.390
Caitlin Fisher: Those applications where it's like what is your dissemination strategy and what are your outreach and thinking like you know, be an organization like this can be part of your dissemination strategy.

283
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:18.240
Caitlin Fisher: And you cannot say that you will amplify you know our network, it could be your network, if you have a book that's coming out if you've got a conference that's coming out if you have a grant.

284
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:31.050
Caitlin Fisher: That could use then you're in you you're looking at the ways in which your results will be made you know will be will enter into Community, so this is something you might not have thought about before so thanks for reminding smart.

285
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:40.020
