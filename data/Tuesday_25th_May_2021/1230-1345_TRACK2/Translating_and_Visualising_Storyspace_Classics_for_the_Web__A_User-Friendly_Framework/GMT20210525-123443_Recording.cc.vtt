WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to translating and visualizing storage space classics for the web, and an evolving user friendly

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
user friendly framework. This is a presentation and workshop.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My name is Manish Pisarski, and we've missed me how for ago. We both affiliated in university of information technology in the management and the rational, but also when I'm research.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:46.000
at Washington State State University Vancouver, where we are working for some time now on this on this framework, which has three, three names of free tags I'm getting to it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Firstly, I'm calling it an automated DIY storage space exporter.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
A hypertext archaeology toolkit. And then it translators toolkit.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And as such, the tool, we are developing is targeted towards translators of electronic literature for authors who have written their works and in on old systems in the storage space, and other early web platforms for researchers and for publishers who

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:38.000
would want to take the old files from old platforms and presented within modern open with languages, what is important to say, of the beginning is that this is not a tool for readers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
As such, this is a tool for those who will then present a reading experience for for the audience.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:02.000
day result of our work on on this particular project will be Michael Joyce's Twilight Symphony, an online version that is planned to be premiered in July 2021.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And let me guys show you just some screenshots of how it looks like and where we are at the moment.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Okay.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is the screenshot of Twilight visible.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is a one of the, one of the possible screens for Michaels over 320 likes Yes.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What we present or what what functionalities are being ported from storage space is a bit changed from whatever we have done previously with storage space classics was translating the words from storage space.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We want to have.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Apart from a link menu or roadmap, we want to have for the first time, storage space maps ported to the online platform, a relational map or logical connection smart or something that I call the network neighborhood mob also implemented.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Apart from conditional linking and random linking present in Twilight.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We want these functionalities to work completely on full throttle without any compromises.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And the idea of the tool, we want to present to you guys is that all these functionalities will not be bound to a twilight Symphony, but will be given to translators to altars and to anyone who has written the work, 30 2020 years ago on these platforms

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and who is interested in presenting it today to their audience, which, which, of course, have grown exponentially from from that time.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, the point of this workshop is first to just give a quick background but with, with this audience that we have here I don't think much of the background is needed

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
some technical introduction.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:48.000
A short, short workflow of something that I called the platform bridge workflow, and then demonstrate to the framework in action, and give some time for questions

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:03.000
at the end of the workshop hopefully we will have some more or less vague idea on how to extract out stories by style to where new software and hardware environment, how to prepare.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Such file for an automated reporting and how to upload the input zip to their web or Java app, and how to get the output zip from the exporter or from that Java app.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In order to further, modify it, and publish it yourself.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
A.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Since the since play like will be debuting in. In July, we still not there yet, there is some CSS styling needed some more work on stories base map.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:06:01.000
They will also be some procedures for manual overwriting of the automated output, and also will be will be presenting the finished toolkit, with a conditional link forms for anyone of the ultra, especially, who used conditional linking and storage space

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to be able to fine tune for his hypertext, an ED conditional links to the places where it is. It has been implemented

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:27.000
our platform, or our, our place so window for the world will be on the storage space export their online website.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And today will be working on the two examples of autism pass by Colin grey matter Patreon Michael Joyce the published in 1991 in the writing on the edge and then republished on the CD ROM in the new media reader.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And also, as an example, as a secondary example on. Whoo, by Michael Joyce published on the same issue of New River. And in the same CD ROM that combine it, new media.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And this is the set background.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I just want to tell.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000
For those who don't know, but I guess everyone knows that we are not inventing anything, anything from scratch, we are not opening the doors that has been already open.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Some porting examples have appeared earlier.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Specifically, one on not an anthology of postmodern fiction, the which published an afternoon a story.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Online expert, that, that was advertised and combining the print the printed apology. Then there was the Robert candles word connection news, a very nice JavaScript framework for porting, the basic concept of storage space to the online environment.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And of course there were the web versions of of storage space works, such as Victory Garden and marvelous things on his gates website.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And another prominent very important example of of a web version is Dina Larson's wiki version of marble springs in terms of these gates demos. These were of course the abridged additions.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:44.000
In terms of the Dina's version of marble springs. This is a full encyclopedic project, and basically we can say that, but many, many functionalities and basically all of the free versions of marble springs are present.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
online within this project.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We are also building on our own shoulders.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
In, in 2012, we have published in Poland, a Polish version of afternoon the story.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:20.000
This was made in XML and XSLT transformer for the browser experience not online yet because of his dates limitations or licensing connected to two after me.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Afternoon story. Then we've got the full green lights to publish online Twilight the symphony in Polish in 2015.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
This was a first fully functioning gate is the work

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
on the line.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And for many many readers, even American audience. It was the first time they could actually access Twilight, and Symphony, because by that time it was, it was already something of a abandon where because it really was not the readers were not really

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
able to open it on any modern platform for for many years.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And then the latest.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:29.000
The latest project in this line of porting migrating and translating of these great classics, his fingers get fit for an acid, which has been just published in the by the team on electronic digital literature lab, and it's a it's a fantastic publishing

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:39.000
project with contemporary edition and Classic Edition, and lots of functionalities mapping.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Also present

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
on all of these.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:14.000
In all of these publications that we supervise in Poland, the, the main premise was to preserve the basic story space concepts of conditional links, basically motor links random links and link buffs, which was not not always easy.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And many of these were preserved, but we have never made a storage space map possible in online versions.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Just to make you aware of how these previous projects were made.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There was a lot of manual work on translating translating conditional links into the online versions as simple JavaScript. Part of my basic condition on the link a basic God fee which which which,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
which was telling the reader to go to a certain place only under a condition.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
A form of simple equation. few equals v.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then these stood for visitors. And then it was the god feet of a place that a leader must have must have not visited before activating the link and then a simple, simple logical of yes or no.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
If visitor if reader visited a place called weather report.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Visit David went to place number one, if not the reader, went to place. Number, the number zero, and a single link in this online version.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:16.000
a single link, a single a talk of HTML used to have from one to 12, sometimes to 25, different trips, and they were numbered. Jeff one was number 021 for free TF to free to, etc.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Sometimes, in order to do a

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:42.000
god fields for a complicated link. I had to manually write that long equation. In order for JavaScript to correctly interpret what what Michael Joy's plan for a given link and it will.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The work on these conditions and testing of these conditions lasted for months.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:14.000
These other those other concepts of storage space that we're only on the harmfully have automated in the previous previous online parts, and that's that new on the map of connections that we want to implement in the 28% for the English online.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:29.000
We also want to implement a breath cramp. This is just a simple navigational tool but quite important for users for readers who might feel lost within the network.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But the basic navigational tool, would be map, and that roadmap.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Link manga.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, I would go in this in this project was to automate the manual labor. into into have two key objectives to manipulate those basic objects of storage space on the temporal and spatial axis, the temporal is a work on the history of reading, and the spatial

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
is is a work on the logic of connections of conditional linking.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And I think this would be a good time for me to introduce you to me how, and perhaps show how some of these basic concepts of storage space, such as link menu or roadmap, and map of the network neighborhood, have been implemented in the Java exporter

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that we are developing.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
So me how if you could take.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Now,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I wish I knew the source codes, when the parts of the source codes.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Right,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
my screen visible.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Yes.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Alright, so here we are. The other part of the whole exporter. I think the most important unreadable part from all the whole big algorithm is the, this HTML presentation of input file, which just as many many fields which are present the life of the reference

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:33.000
profile the contents dyslexia, which was, which is read by the algorithm from the input files.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Just iterate through every file inside the input folder and products for certain.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Look, and looks for HTML files and reads reads from the HTML under estimating inbound and outbound links Alexa from this input files.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And so, what is really good about this representation is that we kind of convert it into any other visual form if we have the, we can get the data from the hypertext then we can convert it into other HTML files or even into Android, Windows or Mac applications

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:44.000
applications are some kinds of ebooks which can be used by readers, or creators of hypertext, if I may.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Just to remind our participants, those basic concepts of inbound inbound connection, and outbound connection of all the segments of the work that are that are leading to the place we are currently reading, and those segments of work that that will lead

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
to go where we currently are is actually enough, the information about these two.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Two types of objects is enough to create, to generate a tree structure of the whole work. And we have a saying now that cutting down a tree structure.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:40.000
But basic variety of files within folders and have connections incoming and upcoming is enough to give us link menu to give us maps to give us any other imaginable structure that we want to visualize for the reader.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And one of those examples, is that the hypertext, a neighborhood map that we will be shipping, a twilight with.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Yes.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:10.000
One important thing is that we are not just cutting the text parts from the HTML file by using kind of the so called or regular regular expressions and once we are actually traversing the DM structure of HTML file and looking for interesting elements.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:40.000
So, the very, think about this way of solving this problem by traveling to the HTML notes, is that the the input files can can be can have different infrastructures and and look only for things but we are interested in and, like, like the inbound and

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Interesting.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Think that we can show.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:05.000
It will be the JavaScript files for the creation of math, and women's, so the JavaScript files from up and links now or later, experts.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yes, we can we can show JavaScript that that are responsible for display on the map as well.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I will have to export now.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
The.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I will have to use the exported to.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Okay. All right.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
So, I think, maybe like maybe we'll do it in the later part of the world.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:45.000
All right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much me how, and let me continue with the next part of the,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
of our presentation.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
our presentation. This is once again.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Turning back for some history, just wanted to tell you that the origin of this particular project that we are doing now, it took place during Michael Joyce's reading.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Last year, that happened to celebrate the two years of afternoon a story, and smart move dropped.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Maybe this suggestion, why we don't use the already existing tools that were used in Polish translations, to help authors who work with studies with storage space to help them with their own works to be presented online and, and this is something that

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I truly believe will will serve.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:56.000
We serve date otters community, and everyone will be able to actually get the old files from our computers, upload to our web application.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And then I had to put an output that is already fully functional. And the only thing left for for an outdoor would be to just style it according to his own needs.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And it also informative for for our goals, was the experience of hypertext travel sells for for authors such as you john for Dina for Catherine cram for Richard Colleton when we, when we see the traverse all of the work that has been.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:52.000
It has been recorded us after the original publication, we can see that the photos are still fascinated that by the storytelling possibilities of that classical platform or storage space.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:13.000
This is something that this is still meaningful, in terms of the history of storytelling of narrative devices and, hopefully, tools, as, as this will will carry the torch and will will

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:28.000
will present these works to new audiences, because we've also seen during the trap ourselves that that young, young audiences are attracted to these forms of

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:51.000
narrative structures, especially now. The hurts when we see the emergence of the new software from to making or personnel writing management such as obsidian, who, who promotes heavy linking any relation of structures.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:08.000
So hopefully, hopefully, this, this tool is also on the wave of written management interest in the network. Writing in the, in the mainstream

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
mainstream but still it's still a bit of them

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
and

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:32.000
see we have a bit of the diagram that Nico is presenting in his poster for the conference where we

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:40.000
where we have visually presents, what is happening on a more abstract level with our part.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
There's an input processor written in Java.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:25:01.000
That takes it takes information from HTML source, and that HTML source initiative initially has been for us, Polish version of play the symphony.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:14.000
But then, for January, reading of Michael Joyce Twilight to for the electronic future laptop so Nicole has abstracted.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
All those functionalities present in the Polish Twilight.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:39.000
In order for it to be something completely autonomous and connect to the processor written in Java, which then processes the inbound links and outbound links, along with the text content and outputs it in, in a completely fresh, but functionality HTML.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
HTML file.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:57.000
The next section, I would like to discuss is is also something probably very basic and quite well known to those of you present.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Both Dina and john AF old max probably of their homes and and try to sometimes collect but these old maps to a to a new software. I don't know if you have some old Macs, at home.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
You don't. Okay.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:45.000
So basically, the idea of anyone to get out of this old file and closed in this old exotic software like Macintosh classic 7.5 or eight or nine is to, in this case, to find a platform bridge.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:59.000
The closest. The closest the software or hardware bridge that can connect our new machine with that old machine.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And we are quite lucky, as, as readers and authors who worked with storage space, because this is a software that is being developed since 1987 published in 1989.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And then,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Then around 2001 2002.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:41.000
When storage space was in its version two and President on both Macs and Windows. It's the center and software called tinderbox appear tend to be state started shipping in developing heavily.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:28:03.000
The tinderbox platform, who, which borrows quite a bit of functionalities from a storage space, such as maps and outline view and inbound outbound export macros, for exporting the HTML.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And because what would follow it was a was a decade of developing tinderbox to be a modern tool for not making an improved for managing your own writing, sort of a personal

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
writing, Assistant.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:39.000
These concepts out concepts of storage space preserved and were and are actually still developed and present on modern platforms.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:58.000
In the end, in around 2016 storage storage storage space free came out and was was being shipped by East Gate but what is very interesting story space free is is a descendant of tinderbox.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:23.000
So as circle, sort of close tinderbox came from storage space, but then the new storage space came out of the Tinder box, which, which makes a very interesting and complex ecosystem of the same or similar family of platforms.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:32.000
and this gives an older a translator and researcher, a good opportunity to,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:50.000
to, to transfer those old functionalities of conditional linking of storage space maps from from the platforms that are 15 to 25 or 30, years old, to modern path.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:57.000
This is something that mark Bernstein, is proud of. And I have to give it to him that.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Because of because of his tending of Tinder box, which was a descendant of storage space. We have now.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:26.000
We have now a platform family that is able to accommodate those old classical hypertext and to form a bridge between old and the new.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:41.000
But sadly, started space free, stop supporting HTML export, and this was probably a very commercially oriented decision on the art of these gates.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So, if we, if we manage to open an old story space file in storage space free, we won't be even able to make this simple HTML part of that old file.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:21.000
That's why, in order for us to have a more fully functional hypertext classic in the online version for example, we need to use a software bridge, which in my case is stylish place to start is going to was probably the most developed and, and web ready

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:37.000
application by these games, and unfortunately, this is, it is now not supported by modern mark.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So, the workflow, I recommend for any of us who who used to work in an old storage space windows or in storage space two or three space. One is to is to have default files, open in storage space to, and then export the storage space to file to a mother

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:14.000
machine via USB internet cable or, or a CD ROM, and then open it is in tinderbox, and from tinderbox, we are ready to go.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And we are ready to present our file in to a two hour Java export.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000
I'm sure that it is, it's sort of in, it can seem a bit complicated.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:48.000
But in fact, it is it is really not in terms of isn't the past and Whoo, which are freely available for anyone who buys the new media either handbook.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
We can just insert the CD into.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:02.000
into old mark that runs, let's say,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:13.000
let's say, Mako is Tiger or Mako is snow light bars, which is able to run storage space to.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Then we opened the file if you're in the past and iPhones, we open it in storage space to. And as soon as we open in disperse those those two. We just need to save it.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And that safe file needs to be transported to modern machine, and then open in a storage space. Once it's done, we are, we are good to go. We are good to give create an export folder.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:14.000
zip folder and. And then our server application of Java transformer Java export them can put can can input can pull this zip into it and export the desired HTML.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
In tinderbox. This procedure is quite, quite simple.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000
We just make sure that we have a preview of HTML experts on each of the files that are open from the old hypertext.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Then we then we generate an HTML template within tinderbox by file HTML template. In this HTML template we enter the export macro inbound links.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And this is a game for us to get this basic story space objects of inbound and outbound links to give us the nodes that precede our current legacy up, and to those that are unbound and will follow from our current space, then our preview in Kindle books

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
works okay and we, we have a list of inbound and outbound connections.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000
We export that hypertext for that work into HTML.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
And then we exhibit a folder,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:46.000
our age in the boat Kindle Kindle books, export file can look us on this illustration. These are just the basic HTML, Americans have of cadence.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:36:06.000
And within that, under the heading text links, we have outbound basically outbound text links, and then inbound basic things about text is, this is, this is enough for a single segment of the storage space.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Classic hypertext to be ready to be a further process for the modern web languages.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Do we have any questions at the moment, because now is the time when, when we will just presume that that zip was already export that the folder is exported visit is created.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:49.000
And now this zip is being passed food to meet how who will work with the zip on the, on the Java application.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I was wondering, you talked about having to do these by hand. Do you have to reprogram every single Alexia and every single link into this HTML by hand or is this done in some automatic sense and then you have to check everything.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Thank you. Thank you, Dina, this is, this is all automated. So, after, after you, you are able away when we're able to import that original story space file, like in the past and move.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
In our example, into a story space to.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:38:00.000
And then after you are able to open that storage space to save file in tinderbox, then it is just a question of following this few steps presented on this slides to make an HTML export of of your hypertext that will already each single segment will already

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:12.000
have a list of inbound links and outbound links that that are related to it. So this this is already automated on the level of that Tinder box export.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And then on the Java application, this will be further automated. And what you will receive. In the end, will be an updated.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:34.000
html structure. html folder that will have these functionalities, such as link menu.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Reading history, and the hypertext neighborhood map.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:56.000
When you say hypertext meant neighborhood map is that the actual map of the Alexia where they're placed within the screen and then you have in storage space you could click on Alexia in the map, and then go down and to the next level and see the Lexi

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:07.000
of that were there so you had some spaces you had a horizontal as well as vertical map, almost three dimensions, if you will.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Our idea is to have.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000
If you are able to see this map that that comes straight from a d3.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
js framework.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:40.000
This map is just showing lecture called memory, and it's a outbound connections on the export of these new paths, we will be able to see the same sort of structure but also with inbound connections.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:40:02.000
So this is an overlay of that network neighborhood, but our intention is to actually give you a reader an option of showing it, either as a logical relation inbound outbound or within the old story space karate of folders within folders, so they will

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:14.000
be two members of this map. Okay, so there will be the hierarchy of folders within folders. Thank you. That's so important. Thank you. I really wanted to implement this and.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And this will be. This is crucial difficult, because once, once we have that three of the hypertext three mapped within the Java, that we have is developing.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Then, The Karate karate is already there, the structure folders is already done is just a question of, of presenting it as such.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And here we start with that relational map, because this is the default default map of the d3. js framework that we use.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Okay. So know that Dr. One addition to that tree structure, we do, we do actually have an algorithm, which is creating that structure and converting it into abstract data structure inside of Java.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
However,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:32.000
but yes, we do have that progress and we will plan to use it in the future, too, because for this moment, we are visualizing visualizing a map with inbound and outbound links but what with the data we currently have.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
We could make a lot more advanced visualization of

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:57.000
that that's why that's why Dina is really spot on, off of that alters point of view, because both john and Dina and anyone who work to storage space are used to those karate Karl Marx,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000
is the this high Korea that example.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:20.000
My English is not very good, especially the best we could make this additional types of mathematics, we would need, we would need additional time to progress and it's not a trivial task.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Make a prototype of every of this map, but to make a more professional product with three reusable components.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:36.000
product with three reusable components. It's hard work to do for one for me for for one program.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
So, manage I think we can proceed to the demo with the exported.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
So I will just share my screen.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
So actually, on this side story space I support online.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:09.000
I have placed the button which, which can redirect you to the directory, with zip file containing a jar file and example input files is me as well.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:19.000
So, Mr file would work perfectly fine on Windows, I don't think it will work on Mac.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000
So, I will present it on my system on Windows. I have downloaded already.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
And we unzip it.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And what we get is to input files, and I says, export an email program.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
After launching the program we get some simple interface and it's within button.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:52.000
And after pressing this button or label points folder, we can specify Kairos directory which we've HTML files.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Let's say, for example, I want to copy this directory places here and select this directory which we've paid HTML files, and the program will interprets all the inputs and outputs in JavaScript files will only the stuff to into the output folder, the

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:33.000
output for the we will appear directly near the assist export to demo, the file, and to. This is the content of the directory, there are some images from libraries, many many HTML.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:41.000
HTML files, some CSS files files. We can open any of this file.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:50.000
We can see the visual representation of the data which we gather this visual representation.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Has the map in science window, you can look up, see where we are in regards to the inbound and outbound links. So,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.000
and also we, what we get is the link money, which we can use to.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Well, which I just had hyperlinks to other fragments inside this folder.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Well, the important thing is, but we don't necessarily, we don't really need to represent the whole hypertext in this in this bunch of HTML files.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:56.000
We can we've that we've had data we can represent an immediate media. We have just chosen to do it in HTML away for, for the sake of the presentation on the demo and show that works and all of these fighters could be just copied and paste that somewhere

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:17.000
on the external server and travels, like some other people that are still sometimes some features. Not features some links may be missing, but most of them is present me How could you could use zoom in on the, on the map.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Yes.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000
So for me, who, who is not a technical guy really, this is all already something very exciting. We have.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:48.000
We've been we've been few minutes we were able to get that rose zipped from storage space to that Java, the program and then Java already explored something that that is fully functioning, although of course it does not look as we would want it to look.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:01.000
But as you can see we have inbound and outbound connection to the current fragment, we have link titles, something that Dina mentions here in the chat that she also wants to see.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:13.000
And we are really going. I hope we are really going in the in the right direction in the twilight would be a demonstration of what is possible within this framework.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:36.000
And also, we want to make you guys for you guys to be able to to tweak your own templates to to implement your own aesthetics, in that template that serves for the generation of the HTML.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So here's another example, we can drag this now, is fully automated we're using decree is my birthday to visualize your allies, all the notes and connection between them.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000
What else could I show manage maybe the JavaScript file which connects the notes and creates these notes.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Yes. Yeah, Let's see now how the JavaScript looks, this would be that structure.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Grabbing.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
js right.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000
I think the most important part is the part where we create them committed enough.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:42.000
I don't really think it's something amazing it's just a for loop, which creates nodes pushes these notes into a graph and then comics is no so it's just a plain simple algorithm, which uses the data, because it into the graph, which then is used by the

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:56.000
different as differently as library to visualize the nodes which we can see inside this window. The same library, could be used for the, for other kinds of maps.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
So,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:11.000
and other dogs good fire would be the links that they as

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
this JavaScript spiral.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Swan coat function

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:32.000
well. Also, there is an automated algorithm, which procedure, it creates the elements and pushes the title of the bench.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:39.000
The hyperlinks to the window and.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Well, it's how it is how it looks like.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:58.000
I don't know if any of you is a programmer or even ever had an experience with programming, that's just a vague idea of how it all looks like on the interesting side.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Once again the concept of just these few basic concepts of inbound and outbound applause, the Ref.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Title, which is the title of the incoming incoming segment of of hypertext, could we do the same me how we've.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Whoo.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Yes.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.000
So how how fast this, this is going to go listen again.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Also an interesting, interesting data here is how many automated operations have succeeded.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
So if if he's in the past.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Let's say 300 300 segments. Look, all of them would be would be perfectly translated right perfectly migrated.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000
So let's try with the world, and the program again.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Let's enter the father of the half points to the root for the ice, select and is done already sounds finished.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.000
That will be fast, less than one second.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
You can open the open.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Mandela.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Nice.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Mandela segment. Oh, this is one bad vendor management.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Oh, yes.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Of course we will we will try to have it as rectangles. And at some point, also have some control over how many of the connections of a visible, because this this is intended as an iPad and iPhone experience even.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:11.000
So, we don't want our readers to get completely,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
completely overwhelmed by the.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
And that's interesting that Mandela had so many connections.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
But yes, this is, this is something

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000
to remember how it looks. And, of course, it's still a work in progress.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Thank you very much, me how the, this was a great presentation of of this EADS of the engine that gets, who's the input of the old story space or old HTML file and outputs it in a, in an environment that preserves those old functionalities.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And some

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:08.000
manual so I think it's important that it's really important to note that this is just a core framework which allows you to do all of these things it's not like one are going to create bunch of HTML files.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:27.000
The whole complex ongoing, which is the data, but puts it into an abstract object structures, and then we can do anything that you want with the structures is like an abstract representation of the hypertext, which is Earth from the inner books and computer

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:39.000
in future can be passed from any other HTML files or forums or other sources. So you can recognize your hypertext.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:59.000
You could, I think I hope in the future when the algorithm is fully finished you could integrate your for work with just one fleet by copying and pasting some into files and manually filling in any, any vote spaces like missing links.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:08.000
but at this moment the algorithm can export most of the fragments like more than 70% of the exported properly.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000
So, that's the one thing I would like. I wanted to add.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:36.000
So, yes, we will work towards a situation that that input file that we serve to the, to the engine is is not dependent on Tinder box so this will be in a case for anyone who created works outside of storage space, platform.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
And hopefully this will already be.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
This will already be.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
This will be quite, quite soon.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:55:00.000
I just want to finalize this section just by mentioning a few points about the future future of this, of this project.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:14.000
So far, we've been working on it under the umbrella of electronically literature lap and that final product of this phase would be Twilight the symphony.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:26.000
But then the next phase arrives, and whatever we can build here will be then further developed under the research ground, Daniel Pl.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:52.000
For the next two, two or three years, and hopefully this will turn into a tool, a writing tool, a collaborative platform that will use the, the maps, and the concept of storage space in this in this new environment, and beyond, 2003, I think.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
This project will branch into, into some,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:11.000
some flagship flagship products of that will be then promoted within the electronic literature center that is being founded in Poland, as we speak.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:35.000
So it all loops that anything we do at the moment, anything we do towards publication of Twilight and towards building this tool for translators and outros will then live on, and and inspire both authors and readers and researchers of electronic literature.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Thank you very much and it's time for questions.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:49.000
And thank you very much for the chat, because it's, it's the, thank you for all the suggestions on the chart

00:56:49.000 --> 00:57:02.000
from Dina and john Roberta Marsh I came back late but I was wondering if you could tell you a little bit more about the plans for the electronic literature center in Poland.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Is that going to be Cracow based project or who's involved, the base of the moment is other misgivings University in Paul's nine, but a.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:29.000
The plans are for it to be a truly, truly, a wider project not bound to any university so we would like the

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:47.000
the center to be placed in different universities have different times, the board will stay the same and the board will be comprised of people from all over Poland, but we also plan to have, have some boards, from the International

00:57:47.000 --> 00:58:10.000
area so we really we really just starting, I'm at the moment at the position of Secretary of the, of the research center of that center and as retiring it's gone from other mysterious University is leading the, the whole, the whole initiative and hopefully

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:24.000
by the end of this month we will be able to announce that the center has been created and will be inviting people to join in for the, for the bar to advise us how we can then operate.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Right, you should probably also get in touch with Joe Tabby about the Consortium for electronic literature.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Yes. And we talked a little bit about stuff like this but it would be good for whatever sort of database or archive that you end up developing out of it for to go out of the box, be able to work with the cell search engine.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Absolutely.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:07.000
The Polish repository of unit will be one of the first first products that center will come up

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
when you have this as a writing tool which will be amazing.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:29.000
It's going to help story space has really been the only way to visualize the relationships between notes and Alexia I think for students, and that horizontal vertical as john mccain was saying 2.5 reality.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:38.000
2.5 dimension reality is going to be huge. When you have that writing space and thank you for it, how will that be distributed.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
How will people know about it,

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
be able to use.

00:59:44.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Thank you. Thank you very much, Dean and the goals of the Daria PL research grant is to is to present the tools that are ready to use open source and are used in in a classroom.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So this will be something that is completely open not not behind a paywall, and the collaborative, collaborative potential of the tool will be tested on a group of authors who created a Polish online collaborative fiction because really, A few years ago,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:36.000
published by heart. And now the same group of people will be creating a pixels do 2.0, and they will be already working on that on this new platform.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So we can, we have funding for this, and hopefully this will be this will be one of the main results of the whole research grant says an amazing opportunity to actually carry the idea of that we've developed and storage space, further into the, into the

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
future.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000
That'll be wonderful. I'm wondering if there's going to be any connections with twine

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000
twine at the moment is used as a prototype.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
but I'm not sure about the connectivity.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Maybe.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Maybe the, we might implement some input options.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:37.000
That might be good and I noticed, and I put this in the chat as well. The way did you have the vision with the circular and the links is so very similar to what America hand off he did with the dictionary of the revolution.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:50.000
It's beautiful work. And I was in touch with America and she was like yeah I programmers would be happy to help provide that type of JavaScript so

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
if you that connection, that would be great cool because that would be a really nice interface.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Thank you. Thank you. This is a very important work, normal globally and if we can cooperate with the programmers that would be fantastic. Because actually, we have already fields are at times, feels the pressure of being the only programmer on the job,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and definitely someone who would prove some ideas or a helping hand, give a helping hand would be very welcome. Great, thank you very much. I'll be I'll be in touch with this, if you guys ever when you get it, you know, In the next few years, hopefully

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
we'll have the second Tuesday. Yellow salon going forever.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
If you want to demo it then.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Feel free to get a spot, you know, just email me for that.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Absolutely.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000
We.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It's amazing work that you're doing.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Thank you. I have actually one questions for you. One question for you about the, The path, objects in storage space.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:17.000
This is something that has been used in in storage space one and in storage space to, there was, there wasn't an object.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
think path right.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Apart from link title, there was a category of links that you could actually subscribe to or name that link that you are creating or, or put it under the umbrella of a specific path.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah, I actually never used, I don't think I ever used that tool particularly.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And this is something I gave up on.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But you know who did do it. Bill Bligh build lie use that object for me to send you got to get in touch with him.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Exactly, yes

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
yeah oh yeah he was talking to me about that one time.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:24.000
So use that object to distinguish between the characters, and if you had read a juris path, then use that objects that you could get on to the ancients.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Yeah, I'm giving you a very smothered recollections so please get directly with Bill he's wonderful.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Thank you. Thank you. That's a very, very good. Good idea, because we are thinking about recreating the box, but I still did not have any idea how to start but be wills work would have been a great, great thing.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yeah, he you know he's got we descend completely in tinderbox, as well as on the web, man he is going to kill you guys because he could have saved himself a lot of work.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yes.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I'll be in touch with me then. Thank you, but

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:24.000
he had to tediously do that all by hand.
