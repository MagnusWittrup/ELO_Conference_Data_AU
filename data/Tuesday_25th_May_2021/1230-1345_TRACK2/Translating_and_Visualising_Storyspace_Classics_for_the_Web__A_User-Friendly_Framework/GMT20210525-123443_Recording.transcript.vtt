WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.730
Mariusz Pisarski: user friendly framework, this is a presentation and workshop, my name is manish pisarski and we've missed me how for now.

2
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.900
Mariusz Pisarski: We both affiliated in university of information technology in the management in the international but also.

3
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:36.690
Mariusz Pisarski: When i'm a research affiliate and we, how is our it assistant in electronic literature lap at Washington state State University Vancouver where we are working for some time now on this on this framework.

4
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.410
Mariusz Pisarski: which has three.

5
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.600
Mariusz Pisarski: Free names of free tags i'm giving to it, firstly.

6
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:58.080
Mariusz Pisarski: i'm calling it an automated DIY storage space exporter a hypertext archaeology toolkit and then it translators toolkit.

7
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.020
Mariusz Pisarski: And, as such, the pool we are developing is targeted towards translators of electronic literature for authors, who have written their works in.

8
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:23.910
Mariusz Pisarski: In on old systems in storage space and other early web platforms for researchers and for publishers who would want to take.

9
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:45.150
Mariusz Pisarski: The old that files from out platforms and presented within modern, open web languages, what is important to say at the beginning, is that this is not a tool for readers as such, this is a tool for those who will then present a reading experience for for the audience.

10
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:59.550
Mariusz Pisarski: The result of our work on on this particular project will be a Michael Josias twilight a safe on a an online version that is planned to be premiered in July 2021.

11
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.030
Mariusz Pisarski: And let me guys show you just some screenshots of.

12
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.030
Mariusz Pisarski: How it looks like and where we are at the moment.

13
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.880
Mariusz Pisarski: Is the screenshot of twilight visible.

14
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.150
Deena Larsen: Yes, but.

15
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.510
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you.

16
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:37.020
Mariusz Pisarski: And this is a one of the one of the possible screens for michaels.

17
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.950
Mariusz Pisarski: Over 320 legs yes.

18
00:02:42.900 --> 00:03:00.840
Mariusz Pisarski: What we present or what what functionalities are being ported from storage space is a bit changed from whatever we have done previously with storage space classics translating the words from storage space we wanted to have.

19
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:14.700
Mariusz Pisarski: Apart from a link menu or roadmap, we want to help for the first time storage space maps port it to the online platform a relational map or logical.

20
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:27.360
Mariusz Pisarski: connection smile or something that I call the network neighbor who map also implemented, apart from conditional linking and random linking present in twilight.

21
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.150
Mariusz Pisarski: We want these functionalities to work completely on on full throttle without any compromises.

22
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:50.340
Mariusz Pisarski: And the the idea of the tool we want to present to you guys, is that all these functionalities will not be bound to try, like a cell phone.

23
00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:16.710
Mariusz Pisarski: But will be given to the translators to altars and to anyone who has written the work effective 2020 years ago on these platforms and who is interested in presenting it today to their audience which which, of course, have grown exponentially from from that time so.

24
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:27.450
Mariusz Pisarski: The point of this workshop is first to just give a quick background, but with with this audience that we have here I don't think much of the background is needed.

25
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:45.390
Mariusz Pisarski: Some technical introduction a short short workflow of something that I call the platform bridge workflow and then demonstrate to the framework in action and give some time for questions.

26
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.240
Mariusz Pisarski: At the end of the workshop hopefully we will have some.

27
00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:01.980
Mariusz Pisarski: More or less vague idea on how to extract out storage space file to a new software and hardware environment, how to prepare.

28
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:24.450
Mariusz Pisarski: Such file for an automated reporting and how to upload the input zip to the word or Java APP and how to get the output zip from the exporter or from that Java APP in order to feather modify it and publish it yourself.

29
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.030
Mariusz Pisarski: A.

30
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:39.420
Mariusz Pisarski: Since the since by like will be debuting in in July, we still not there yet there is some CSS styling needed some more work on storage space map.

31
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:53.520
Mariusz Pisarski: They will also be some procedures for manual of the writing of the ultimate output and also will be will be presenting the the finished the toolkit with a conditional link forms.

32
00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:03.030
Mariusz Pisarski: For anyone of the altos especially who used conditional linking and storage space to be able to fine tune it.

33
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.400
Mariusz Pisarski: Is hypertext an ED conditional links to the places where it is, it has been implemented.

34
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:23.250
Mariusz Pisarski: Our platform or our our place so window for the world will be on the storage space export their online website.

35
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.540
Mariusz Pisarski: And today we'll be working on the two examples of.

36
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:44.250
Mariusz Pisarski: Of on season pass by Colin grey matter patreon Michael Joyce the published in 1991 in writing on the edge and then republished on CD Rom in the new media reader.

37
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:58.440
Mariusz Pisarski: And also, as an example as a secondary example on whoo by Michael Joyce published in the same issue of new river in the same CD Rom that a combine it new media reader.

38
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:21.300
Mariusz Pisarski: And this is the set the background, I just want to tell for those who don't know but I guess, everyone knows that we are not inventing anything anything from scratch, we are not opening the doors that has been already open some porting examples have appeared earlier.

39
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:29.430
Mariusz Pisarski: Specifically, one on not an anthology of postmodern fiction, the which published and afternoon, a story.

40
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:45.030
Mariusz Pisarski: Online except that that was advertised and combining the print the printed anthology then there was Robert candles word connection news a very nice.

41
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:57.960
Mariusz Pisarski: javascript framework for a parting the basic concept of storage space to a the online environment and, of course, they were they were versions of.

42
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:06.990
Mariusz Pisarski: of storage space works such as victory garden and marvelous things on these gates website.

43
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:24.600
Mariusz Pisarski: And another prominent and very important example of the Web version is dina larson's wiki version of marble springs in terms of these gates demos, these were of course the abridged additions in terms of readiness.

44
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.790
Mariusz Pisarski: version of marble springs, this is a full encyclopedic.

45
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:45.210
Mariusz Pisarski: Project and basically we can say that, but many, many functionalities and and basically all of the free versions of marble springs are present online within this project.

46
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.610
Mariusz Pisarski: We got also building on our own shoulders.

47
00:08:52.110 --> 00:09:11.010
Mariusz Pisarski: In in 2012 we have published in Poland to Polish version of afternoon the story, this was made in the xml and access it transformer for the browser experience not online yet.

48
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:28.650
Mariusz Pisarski: Because of dates limitations or licensing connected to to do after me story then we've got a full green lights to publish online twilight the symphony in Polish in 2015.

49
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.680
Mariusz Pisarski: This was the first fully functioning is great is that work.

50
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:49.890
Mariusz Pisarski: out that online and for many, many readers even American audience, it was the first time they could actually access twilight and symphony because by that time it was it was already.

51
00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:02.520
Mariusz Pisarski: Something of a band on where, because it really was not demetrius we're not really able to open it on any modern platform for for many years.

52
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:15.120
Mariusz Pisarski: And then the latest, the latest project in this line of porting migrating and translating of these great classics is figures get in for an acid.

53
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.870
Mariusz Pisarski: which has been just published in the by the team on.

54
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:37.230
Mariusz Pisarski: Electronic which, to which our lab and it's a it's a fantastic publishing project with contemporary edition and classic edition and lots of functionalities mapping.

55
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.020
Mariusz Pisarski: Also present.

56
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.020
Mariusz Pisarski: On all of these.

57
00:10:47.940 --> 00:11:11.970
Mariusz Pisarski: In all of these publications that we had for supervised in Poland, the the main premise was to preserve the basic story space concepts of conditional links basic links mortal beings random links and and link paths which was not always not always easy.

58
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.090
Mariusz Pisarski: And many of these were preserved, but we have never made a storage space not.

59
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.710
Mariusz Pisarski: Possible in online versions.

60
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.710
Mariusz Pisarski: Just to make you aware how these previous projects.

61
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.530
Mariusz Pisarski: were made, there was a lot of manual work on translating.

62
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:47.730
Mariusz Pisarski: Translating conditioner links into the online versions as simple javascript part of my basic condition.

63
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.110
Mariusz Pisarski: On the link a basic Godfrey which which which.

64
00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:03.150
Mariusz Pisarski: which was telling the reader to go to a certain place only under a condition.

65
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:16.590
Mariusz Pisarski: A form of simple equation few equals V and then we stood for visitors and then it was the garfield have a place that.

66
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:26.040
Mariusz Pisarski: They read there must have must have not visited before activating the link and then it's simple simple logical.

67
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.170
Mariusz Pisarski: Yes or no if visit the if the reader visited a place called weather report.

68
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:51.000
Mariusz Pisarski: Is David went to place number one, if not the reader went to place number number zero and a single link in this online version.

69
00:12:52.620 --> 00:13:08.580
Mariusz Pisarski: A single link a single a tack of html used to have from one to 12 sometimes to 25 different tracks and they were numbered Jeff one was number zero to one for the free to.

70
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.540
Mariusz Pisarski: free to etc.

71
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.880
Mariusz Pisarski: Sometimes, in order to to do a.

72
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.070
Mariusz Pisarski: God fields for a complicated link I had to manually right that.

73
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:40.590
Mariusz Pisarski: Long equation in order for javascript to correctly interpret what what Michael Joyce plan for a given link and it will this was very tedious.

74
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.560
Mariusz Pisarski: The work on these conditions and testing of this conditions lasted for months.

75
00:13:53.610 --> 00:14:11.550
Mariusz Pisarski: These other those other concepts of storage space that we're only on the harmfully have automated in the previous previous online ports and that's that new one, the map of connections that we want to implement in the twilight is funny in English online.

76
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:32.730
Mariusz Pisarski: We also want to implement the breadcrumbs, this is just a simple navigational tool, but quite important for users for readers who might feel lost within the network, but the basic navigation or two would be map and that roadmap.

77
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:34.890
Mariusz Pisarski: Link manga.

78
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:42.450
Mariusz Pisarski: So I would go in this in this project was to optimize the manual Labor and to.

79
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.280
Mariusz Pisarski: into.

80
00:14:46.380 --> 00:15:06.600
Mariusz Pisarski: Two key objectives to manipulate those basic objects of storage space on temporal and spatial axis the temporal is a work on the history of reading and the spatial is is a work on the logic of of connections of conditional linking.

81
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:29.040
Mariusz Pisarski: And I think this would be a good time for me to introduce you to meet how and perhaps show how some of these basic concepts of storage space, such as link menu or roadmap and the map of the network neighborhood have been implemented in a Java.

82
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.660
Mariusz Pisarski: exporter that we are developing.

83
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.220
Mariusz Pisarski: So me how, if you could take.

84
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.770
Micha? Furga?: source codes.

85
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.230
Micha? Furga?: Is my screen visible.

86
00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:08.700
Micha? Furga?: Yes, alright So here we are the data part of the whole exporter and that's I think the most important untreatable part from all call big argerich misty.

87
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:21.240
Micha? Furga?: This html or presentation of input file, which just has many, many fields, which represents the related of the reference to file the contents.

88
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.130
Micha? Furga?: dyslexia.

89
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:30.300
Micha? Furga?: which was, which is read by their ongoing from the input files.

90
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:32.730
Micha? Furga?: Just.

91
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:51.360
Micha? Furga?: iterate through every file inside the input folder and looks for certain look and looks for html files and the roots roots from this html under is raining inbound and outbound things and alexa from this input files.

92
00:16:52.380 --> 00:17:03.240
Micha? Furga?: And then it transforms the but input html input into I object oriented class which is visible here under the name of it and i'll file.

93
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:21.960
Micha? Furga?: And so what is really good about this representation is that we can convert it into any other visual form if we have the we can get the data from the hypertext, then we can convert it into other html files or even.

94
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.660
Micha? Furga?: into android windows or MAC applications.

95
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.600
Micha? Furga?: All kinds of ebooks which can be used by.

96
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.190
Micha? Furga?: readers are creators of hypertext.

97
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:53.070
Mariusz Pisarski: If I may need help, just to remind our participants those basic concepts of inbound inbound connection and outbound connection or the segments.

98
00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:02.760
Mariusz Pisarski: Of the work that are that are leading to the place, we are currently reading and those segments of work that that will lead to where we currently are.

99
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:16.230
Mariusz Pisarski: is actually enough, the information about these two two types of objects, is the Navajo creates to generate a tree structure of the whole work and what we have.

100
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:25.710
Mariusz Pisarski: is saying now that having the tree structure but basic variety of files within folders and have connections.

101
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:48.210
Mariusz Pisarski: incoming and outgoing is enough to give us link menu, to give us maps to give us any other imaginable structure that you want to visualize for the reader and one of those examples is that the hypertext a neighborhood map that we will be shipping a twilight.

102
00:18:50.340 --> 00:19:10.890
Micha? Furga?: Yes, one one important thing is what we are not just getting the text parts from the html file by using the so called or regular regular expressions, but we are actually realizing that the structure of html file and looking for interesting elements, so the.

103
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:18.510
Micha? Furga?: Very good, think about this way of solving this problem by traumas in the html notes is that.

104
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.160
The.

105
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:31.140
Micha? Furga?: The input files can can be can have different infrastructures and i'll go ahead and look only for things, but we are interested in and.

106
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:43.680
Micha? Furga?: Like like the inbound and outbound links so minor differences between the input files will not break the brilliant Calgary so it's I think it's interesting and maybe we'll go to the next.

107
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.360
Micha? Furga?: interesting and think that we can show.

108
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.780
Micha? Furga?: It wouldn't be the javascript.

109
00:19:53.010 --> 00:20:01.950
Micha? Furga?: files for the creation of math and my wish or so the javascript files from and links now or later.

110
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:03.870
Experts.

111
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.100
Mariusz Pisarski: We can we can show the javascript that.

112
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.300
Mariusz Pisarski: that are responsible for display on the map as well.

113
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.770
Micha? Furga?: I would have to export now.

114
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.180
Micha? Furga?: The other have to use the portrait to.

115
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.100
Mariusz Pisarski: Okay, all right.

116
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.360
Micha? Furga?: So I think, maybe like maybe we'll do it.

117
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:34.890
Mariusz Pisarski: In the later part of the model sure sure all right, and thank you very much, thank you very much me how and.

118
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.750
Mariusz Pisarski: Let me.

119
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.700
Mariusz Pisarski: continue with the next part of the.

120
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.810
Mariusz Pisarski: of our presentation.

121
00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.590
Mariusz Pisarski: This is once again a.

122
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.740
Mariusz Pisarski: turning back for some history.

123
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.980
Mariusz Pisarski: just wanted to tell you.

124
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:03.660
Mariusz Pisarski: That the origin of this particular project that we are doing now, it took place during the Michael joyce's.

125
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:14.580
Mariusz Pisarski: Reading a last year that happened to celebrate the 20 years of afternoon, a story and sweat was dropped for.

126
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:24.540
Mariusz Pisarski: Maybe this suggestion, why we don't use the already existing tools that we use in Polish translations to help.

127
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:38.670
Mariusz Pisarski: authors who work with status mystery space to help them with their own works to be presented online and, and this is something that I truly believe will will serve.

128
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:54.540
Mariusz Pisarski: We serve the stakeholders community and everyone would be able to to actually get the old files from our computers upload to our web application.

129
00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:08.280
Mariusz Pisarski: And then Kevin Kevin output, that is already fully functional and the only thing left for for an outdoor would be to just style it according to his own needs.

130
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.980
Mariusz Pisarski: and

131
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:29.850
Mariusz Pisarski: It also informative for for our goals, was the experience of hypertext trouble cells for for auto such as you john for dina for Katrina cram for Richard colleton.

132
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:43.440
Mariusz Pisarski: When we when we see the traverse all of the work that has been it has been record that to us after the original publication, we can see that that the voters are still.

133
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:53.550
Mariusz Pisarski: fascinated that by the storytelling possibilities of that classical platform or storage space, this is something that this is still.

134
00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:06.180
Mariusz Pisarski: Meaningful in terms of the history of storytelling of narrative devices and hopefully tools as, as this will will carry the torch and.

135
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.340
Mariusz Pisarski: Will will.

136
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.460
Mariusz Pisarski: will present these works to new audiences because we've also seen.

137
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.570
Mariusz Pisarski: During the trouble cells that that young young audiences are attracted to these forms of.

138
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:44.070
Mariusz Pisarski: narrative structures, especially now perhaps when we see the emergence of the new software for filmmaking or personal writing management, such as obsidian who who promote.

139
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.550
Mariusz Pisarski: Heavy linking and relational.

140
00:23:48.870 --> 00:24:03.570
Mariusz Pisarski: Structures So hopefully hopefully this this tool is also on a wave of written management interest in the network writing in the in the mainstream.

141
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.920
Mariusz Pisarski: looks nice to.

142
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.450
Mariusz Pisarski: See, we have a bit of.

143
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:25.890
Mariusz Pisarski: The diagram adapt to me how is presenting in his poster for the conference.

144
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.170
Mariusz Pisarski: Where we.

145
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.320
Mariusz Pisarski: Where we have visually presents what is happening on a more abstract level with our power.

146
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.620
Mariusz Pisarski: there's an input processor written in Java that takes.

147
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.720
Mariusz Pisarski: It takes information from html.

148
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.430
Mariusz Pisarski: source and that html source.

149
00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:11.460
Mariusz Pisarski: Initially, has been for us Polish version of play the symphony but then for January reading of Michael Joyce twilight to for the E electronically to chill out reversal NICO has obstructed.

150
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:24.060
Mariusz Pisarski: All those functionalities present in the Polish twilight in order for it to be something completely autonomous and connect to the processor written in Java.

151
00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:39.090
Mariusz Pisarski: which then processes, the inbound and outbound links, along with the text content and outputs it in in a completely fresh but functional html html file.

152
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:54.060
Mariusz Pisarski: The next section I would like to discuss is is also something probably very basic and quite well known to those of you present.

153
00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:03.960
Mariusz Pisarski: Both dina and john a half old Max probably of the homes and.

154
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:16.890
Mariusz Pisarski: Try to sometimes connect but, as this old maps to a to a new software I don't know if you Rebecca have some old MACs at home.

155
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.500
Mariusz Pisarski: You don't okay.

156
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:34.530
Mariusz Pisarski: So basically the idea of of anyone to get out of this old file enclosed in this old exotic software like MacIntosh classic.

157
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:55.260
Mariusz Pisarski: 7.5 or eight or nine is to in this case, to find a platform in bridge and the closest the closest the software or hardware bridge that can connect our new machine with that old machine.

158
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:16.680
Mariusz Pisarski: And we are quite lucky us as readers and altos who worked with storage space, because this is a software that is being developed since 1987 published in 1989 and then.

159
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:42.360
Mariusz Pisarski: Then at around 2001 2002 when storage space was in its version two and President on both MACs and windows it's the Center and software called tinderbox appeal tend to be state started shipping and developing heavily that tinderbox platform.

160
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:57.210
Mariusz Pisarski: Who which borrows quite a bit of functionalities from storage space, such as maps and outline view and inbound outbound export.

161
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:19.110
Mariusz Pisarski: macros for exporting the html and because what what followed was a was a decade of developing tinderbox to be a modern tool for not making an improved for managing your own writing a sort of a person or.

162
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.430
Mariusz Pisarski: Writing assistant.

163
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:37.290
Mariusz Pisarski: A these concepts out concepts of storage space preserved and were and are actually still developed and present a modern platforms.

164
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.940
Mariusz Pisarski: And, in the end in around 2016.

165
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:54.810
Mariusz Pisarski: started it started it started space free a came out and was being shipped by the East gate, but what is very interesting story space free is this.

166
00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:08.550
Mariusz Pisarski: A descendant of tinder box so circle sort of closed tinderbox came from storage space, but then the new storage space came out of a tinderbox.

167
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:29.850
Mariusz Pisarski: Which which makes a very interesting and complex ecosystem of other the same or similar family of platforms and this gives an outdoor a translator and researcher a good opportunity to.

168
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.490
Mariusz Pisarski: To.

169
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:49.200
Mariusz Pisarski: to transfer those old functionalities of conditional linking of storage space maps from the from the platforms that are 30 to 25 or 30 years old, to modern platforms.

170
00:29:49.650 --> 00:30:05.010
Mariusz Pisarski: This is something that mark bearish trend is proud of and and I have to give it to him that, because of because of his tending of tinder box, which was a descendant of storage space, we have now.

171
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.340
Mariusz Pisarski: We have now a platform, time is that it is able to accommodate.

172
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:17.700
Mariusz Pisarski: Those old classical hypertext and to format which.

173
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.430
Mariusz Pisarski: is coming out and the new.

174
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:39.120
Mariusz Pisarski: But sadly in storage space free stopped supporting html export and this was probably a very commercially oriented decision on on the part of these gates.

175
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:51.630
Mariusz Pisarski: So if we if we manage to open an altar space file in storage space free, we want to be even able to make a simple html part of that old file.

176
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:59.070
Mariusz Pisarski: that's why, in order for us to to have a more fully functional.

177
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:09.480
Mariusz Pisarski: hypertext classic in the online version, for example, we need to use software bridge which, in my case.

178
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:16.320
Mariusz Pisarski: is solid place to start space to was probably the most.

179
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.510
Mariusz Pisarski: developed and and web ready application.

180
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:30.330
Mariusz Pisarski: By easy games and, unfortunately, a this is, it is now not supported by modern MAC.

181
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:43.020
Mariusz Pisarski: So the workflow I recommend for any of us who who used to work in.

182
00:31:44.700 --> 00:32:03.420
Mariusz Pisarski: storage space windows or in storage space to or storage space, one is to is to have the old files open in storage space to and then export the storage space to file to a modern machine via USB ethernet cable or.

183
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:15.990
Mariusz Pisarski: or a CD Rom and then open, it is in tinderbox and something that works, we are ready to go and we are ready to present our file.

184
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.540
Mariusz Pisarski: In to it to our Java export.

185
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:41.250
Mariusz Pisarski: i'm sure that it is it's sort of the king, it can seem a bit complicated, but in fact it is, it is really not in terms of easily pass and whoo which are freely available.

186
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:46.770
Mariusz Pisarski: For anyone who buys the new media reader handbook.

187
00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:53.130
Mariusz Pisarski: We can just insert the CD into a into a.

188
00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.440
Mariusz Pisarski: Old Man that runs let's say.

189
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:06.240
Mariusz Pisarski: let's say motto is tiger or motto is snow last part.

190
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.950
Mariusz Pisarski: Which is able to run storage space to.

191
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.090
Mariusz Pisarski: Then we open the file here.

192
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.810
Mariusz Pisarski: isn't the past and the blue icons.

193
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:27.690
Mariusz Pisarski: We open it in storage space to, and as soon as we open in disperse no space to We just need to save it.

194
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:55.980
Mariusz Pisarski: And that saved file needs to be transported to a modern machine and then open in storage space once it's done, we are, we are good to go, we are good, to give a creator an export folder the zip that folder and and then our server application or Java.

195
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:09.510
Mariusz Pisarski: transformer Java export them can put it can can input, you can pull it this the zipper into it and export the desired html.

196
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:29.010
Mariusz Pisarski: In tinderbox this procedure is is quite quite simple, we just make sure that we have a preview of html export on each of the files that are open from the old hypertext then we.

197
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:57.300
Mariusz Pisarski: Then we generate an html template within tinderbox by file html template in this html template we enter the export macro inbound links, and this is again for us to to get this basic storage space objects of inbound links and outbound links to give us the nodes that receipt our current.

198
00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:23.880
Mariusz Pisarski: Alexia and to those that the unbound and will follow up for our current meeting space, then our preview in tinderbox works Okay, and we, we have a list of inbound and outbound connections, we export that hypertext for that work into html and then we zip the folder.

199
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:33.600
Mariusz Pisarski: And our age, a thunderbolt thunderbolt in their books export file can look.

200
00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.600
Mariusz Pisarski: us on this.

201
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:46.950
Mariusz Pisarski: radio station, these are just the basic html markings of the headings and, within that.

202
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.940
Mariusz Pisarski: Under the heading text links we have.

203
00:35:52.320 --> 00:36:14.010
Mariusz Pisarski: outbound basically outbound text links and then inbound basic things anything about Texas, this is this is enough for a single segment of the storage space classic hypertext to be ready to be processed for the modern web languages.

204
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:37.260
Mariusz Pisarski: Do we have any questions at the moment because now is the time when when we will just presumed that that zip is already export that the folder is exported the zip is created, and now this is being passed through to me how cool work.

205
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.060
Mariusz Pisarski: On the on the Java application.

206
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.990
Deena Larsen: I was wondering.

207
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:58.830
Deena Larsen: You talked about having to do these by hand, do you have to reprogram every single Alexia and every single link into this.

208
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.130
Deena Larsen: html by hand or.

209
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.470
Deena Larsen: Is this done in some automatic sense and then you have to check everything.

210
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.340
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you, thank you.

211
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.950
Mariusz Pisarski: dina this is this is.

212
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:30.990
Mariusz Pisarski: All automated so after after you, you are able away when we're able to import that original story space file like easy path and move in our example into a storage space to.

213
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:39.840
Mariusz Pisarski: And then, after you are able to open that story space to save file in tinderbox.

214
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.250
Mariusz Pisarski: Then it is just a question of following these.

215
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.360
Mariusz Pisarski: few steps presented on this slide.

216
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.800
Mariusz Pisarski: To make an html export.

217
00:37:53.850 --> 00:38:12.090
Mariusz Pisarski: Of of your hyper text that will already each single segment will already have a list of inbound links and outbound links that that are related to it, so this, this is already automated on the level of that tinderbox export and then.

218
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.180
Mariusz Pisarski: On the Java application.

219
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:23.190
Mariusz Pisarski: This will be feather automated and what you will receive in the end will be a an updated.

220
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:32.790
Mariusz Pisarski: html structure extra folder that will have these functionalities such as link menu.

221
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:38.100
Mariusz Pisarski: Reading history and the hypertext neighborhood map.

222
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:47.490
Deena Larsen: When you say hypertext neighborhood map is that the actual map of the lexi aware they're placed within the screen and then you have.

223
00:38:48.510 --> 00:39:03.960
Deena Larsen: In storage space, you could click on Alexia in the map and then go down to the next level and see the lexi of that were there, so you had subspecies you had a horizontal as well as vertical map of three dimensions, if you know.

224
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.400
Mariusz Pisarski: Our idea is to have.

225
00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.850
Mariusz Pisarski: If you're able to see this map.

226
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:26.730
Mariusz Pisarski: That that comes straight from a D3 js framework this map is just showing an alexa called memory and it's a outbound connections.

227
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:35.880
Mariusz Pisarski: On the export of these may pass, we will be able to see the same sort of structure, but also with inbound connections.

228
00:39:38.730 --> 00:40:03.000
Mariusz Pisarski: So this is a logical overlaid of that network neighborhood but our intention is to actually give you or reader an option of showing it either as a logical relation inbound outbound or within the old story space variety of folders within folders so they will be to have this now.

229
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:09.060
Deena Larsen: Okay, so there will be the hierarchy of folders within folders Thank you that's so important.

230
00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:09.900
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you.

231
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.340
Mariusz Pisarski: I really wanted to.

232
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.730
Mariusz Pisarski: implement this and, and this will be.

233
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.930
Deena Larsen: This is crucial.

234
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:27.300
Mariusz Pisarski: difficult because once once we have that three of the hypertext three mapped within the Java button, how is developing.

235
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:45.030
Mariusz Pisarski: Then the karate karate is already there, the structure folders is already done is just a question of of presenting it as such, and here we start with that relational map, because this is the default default map of the day.

236
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.860
Mariusz Pisarski: D3 js.

237
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.900
Mariusz Pisarski: framework that we use.

238
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.300
Mariusz Pisarski: Okay.

239
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.780
Mariusz Pisarski: So Hello up there.

240
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.400
Micha? Furga?: One addition to that.

241
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:07.170
Micha? Furga?: tree structure we do we do actually have an algorithm which is creating that structure and converting it into abstract later structure is our job.

242
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.120
Micha? Furga?: However.

243
00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:19.800
Micha? Furga?: But yes, we do have that algorithm this moment we will plan to use it in the future.

244
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:34.860
Micha? Furga?: too, because for this moment we are visualizing visualizing a map with inbound and outbound links, but what with the data we currently have we could make a lot more advanced visualization of.

245
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:54.030
Mariusz Pisarski: That that's why that's why dina is is really spot on of of that alters point of view, because both john and dina and anyone who wanted to start a space, I used to those hierarchical maps.

246
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:56.550
Is.

247
00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.540
Micha? Furga?: This hi hi and I.

248
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.370
Micha? Furga?: called my example.

249
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:08.010
Micha? Furga?: My English very good, especially on this first.

250
00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:17.430
Micha? Furga?: We could make this additional types of mathematics, we would just we would we would need additional time to progress is not.

251
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:30.780
Micha? Furga?: Well it's a trivial task to make a prototype of every of this mapping bus to make a more professional product with three you reusable components it's hard work to do, for one.

252
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.380
Micha? Furga?: From if one for one program so much, I think we can now proceed to.

253
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.140
Micha? Furga?: The DEMO the exporter.

254
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.140
Micha? Furga?: So I will just share my screen.

255
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.450
Micha? Furga?: So actually on this side story space expert online.

256
00:42:52.980 --> 00:43:01.140
Micha? Furga?: I have placed the button which which can redirect you to the directory with zip file containing a.

257
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.600
Micha? Furga?: jar file and to example input files is me and to whoa.

258
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:14.430
Micha? Furga?: So this jar file would work perfectly fine on windows I don't think it will work on MAC.

259
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:16.830
But so.

260
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:25.020
Micha? Furga?: So I was presented on my system on windows, I have downloaded already and we'll unzip it.

261
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:39.330
Micha? Furga?: And what we get is to input files, and this is exported DEMO program after lunch program we get sound simple interface and sweet with one button.

262
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.180
Micha? Furga?: And after pressing this button.

263
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:50.490
Micha? Furga?: Will label points, the third one folder we can specify art director, which is with html files.

264
00:43:51.690 --> 00:44:02.100
Micha? Furga?: let's say, for example, I will copy this path for this directory places here and select this directory which he with a html files.

265
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:10.380
Micha? Furga?: And the program will interprets all the inputs and outputs javascript files.

266
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:23.550
Micha? Furga?: will only the stuff into the output folder the output folder we are will appear directly nearly as expected DEMO that jar file.

267
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:45.570
Micha? Furga?: and through the, this is the content of the output directory, there are some images from libraries many, many html html files some CSS files files, we can open a new this file and what we can see the visual representation of the data which we gather.

268
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:53.910
Micha? Furga?: This visual presentation has the math and science window, we can look up.

269
00:44:54.990 --> 00:45:00.780
Micha? Furga?: see where we are with regards to the album and things so.

270
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.920
Micha? Furga?: And also, we what we get is the link money which we can use to.

271
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:23.970
Micha? Furga?: Well, which I just had hyperlinks to other fragments inside this folder well, the important thing is, but we don't necessarily we don't really need to represent the whole.

272
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.090
hypertext in.

273
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.470
Micha? Furga?: This in this bunch of html files.

274
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:42.720
Micha? Furga?: We can with that data we can represent an immediate, we have just chosen to do it in html5 for.

275
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:50.070
Micha? Furga?: For the sake of the presentation on the DEMO and show that works and.

276
00:45:51.360 --> 00:46:05.550
Micha? Furga?: All of these fighters could just copy and paste it somewhere on the external server and travels like some other people that are still sometimes some pictures not speakers some links may be missing.

277
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.590
Micha? Furga?: But most of them is present.

278
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:16.620
Mariusz Pisarski: me how could you could use zoom in on a on a map is a bridge.

279
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:31.560
Mariusz Pisarski: So for me who he who is not a technical guy really This is all already something very exciting, we have we've been with few minutes, we were able to get that roses.

280
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:43.740
Mariusz Pisarski: From storage space to that Java program and then Java already exports, something that that is fully functioning, although of course.

281
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:56.310
Mariusz Pisarski: It does not look as we would want it to look, but, as you can see, we have an inbound and outbound connection to the current fragment we have the link titles, something that dina mentions.

282
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:05.160
Mariusz Pisarski: Here in the chat that she also wants to see, and we are really going I hope we are really going in the in the right.

283
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:20.910
Mariusz Pisarski: direction and that twilight would be a demonstration of of what is possible within this framework, and also, we want to make you guys for you guys, to be able to to tweak your own templates.

284
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:31.230
Mariusz Pisarski: To to implement your own aesthetics in that template that serves the other generation of the html.

285
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:47.280
Micha? Furga?: So if here's another example we can drag this now is fully animated we are using the previous library to visualize usual allies Nelson connection between them.

286
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:54.600
Micha? Furga?: What else could I show management, be the javascript file which connects to denounce and creates these notes.

287
00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:04.020
Mariusz Pisarski: Yes, yeah let's see now how the javascript looks this would be that structure.

288
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.490
Mariusz Pisarski: Robin js right.

289
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.530
So.

290
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.420
Micha? Furga?: I think the most important part is the part where we create that connection.

291
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:24.750
Micha? Furga?: Think is something amazing it's just a for loop which.

292
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:31.560
Micha? Furga?: creates nodes pushes these notes into a graph and then comics is no so.

293
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.740
Micha? Furga?: it's just a plain simple algorithm.

294
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:46.950
Micha? Furga?: which uses the data and pushes it into the graph which then is used by the different as differentiate as library to visualize the nodes which we can see.

295
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:55.680
Micha? Furga?: inside this window on the same library could be used for the for other kinds of maps so.

296
00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.700
Micha? Furga?: Another good file would be.

297
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.130
Micha? Furga?: The links, that is.

298
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.790
Micha? Furga?: This javascript file.

299
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.060
Micha? Furga?: As one called function.

300
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:19.320
Micha? Furga?: Well, also.

301
00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:26.160
Micha? Furga?: There is an automated algorithm which procedure, it creates.

302
00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:30.150
Micha? Furga?: The elements and pushes the title the age.

303
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.660
Micha? Furga?: The hyperlinks into the.

304
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.000
Micha? Furga?: window and.

305
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:44.640
Micha? Furga?: Well it's how it is how it looks like I don't know if any of you is a programmer or even.

306
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:46.230
Micha? Furga?: ever had.

307
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:47.670
Micha? Furga?: An.

308
00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:56.970
Micha? Furga?: Experience with programming that's just an idea of how it all looks like on the international side.

309
00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:08.820
Mariusz Pisarski: And once again the concept of just these few basic concepts of inbound and outbound applause, the ref title, which is the title of the incoming.

310
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:13.380
Mariusz Pisarski: incoming a segment of of hypertext.

311
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:24.660
Mariusz Pisarski: Could we do the same me how with whoo whoo yes, so how how fast this this is going to go.

312
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:26.280
Micha? Furga?: On again.

313
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:49.680
Mariusz Pisarski: Also, an interesting an interesting data here is how many automated automation scripts succeeded, so if if easily fast let's say 300 300 segments, not all of them would be would be perfectly just like a try, but the.

314
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.230
Mariusz Pisarski: migrated.

315
00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:54.600
Mariusz Pisarski: done.

316
00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.590
Micha? Furga?: So let's try with the moon and.

317
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:06.330
Micha? Furga?: return the problem again let's enter the founder of the directory stopping.

318
00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:16.530
Micha? Furga?: points to do it for them by select and it's done already sounds finished is that really fast, less than one second.

319
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.480
Can.

320
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.070
open.

321
00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:26.280
Mariusz Pisarski: Mandela.

322
00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.120
Micha? Furga?: Mandela segment.

323
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.550
Mariusz Pisarski: This is vendor.

324
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:36.210
management.

325
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.600
Mariusz Pisarski: Oh yes.

326
00:51:45.000 --> 00:52:06.930
Mariusz Pisarski: Of course we will we will try to have it as rectangles and at some point also have some control over how many of the connections of a visible, because this This is intended as an iPad and iPhone experience, even so, we don't want our readers to get completely.

327
00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.610
Mariusz Pisarski: completely overwhelmed by the.

328
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.530
Mariusz Pisarski: that's interesting that Mandela had so many connections.

329
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.980
Mariusz Pisarski: But yes, this is, this is something.

330
00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:44.640
Mariusz Pisarski: to remember how it looks and of course it's still a work in progress, thank you very much me how the disposable a great presentation of the of this each of the engine that gets pushed the input of the old story space or html file and outputs it in a.

331
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.970
Mariusz Pisarski: In an environment that preserves those old functionalities as.

332
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.100
Micha? Furga?: One of.

333
00:52:53.130 --> 00:53:07.080
Micha? Furga?: The addition manual sure I think it's important it's very important to note that this is just I core framework which allows to do all of these things it's not like one are going to create bunch of html files.

334
00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:22.440
Micha? Furga?: Is the whole complex unbelief which reads the data but puts it into an abstract object structures and then we can do anything that you want to the structures is like an abstract representation of the hypertext.

335
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:44.610
Micha? Furga?: Which is passed from the tinderbox and in future can be parsed from any other html files or forums or other sources, so you can recognize your hypertext you could, I think I hope in the future when the announcements purely purely finished, you could circulate your.

336
00:53:46.290 --> 00:54:06.660
Micha? Furga?: For work with just one played by copying and pasting some input files and manually feeling clean any any votes spices like you think wings, but at this moment, the unwritten can export most of the fragments like more than 70% of the families are exported properly.

337
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.310
So.

338
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.990
Micha? Furga?: that's The one thing I would like, I wanted to add, thank you.

339
00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.490
Mariusz Pisarski: So, yes, we will work towards a situation that that.

340
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:42.090
Mariusz Pisarski: input file that we serve to the to the engine is is not dependent on a tinderbox so this will be in a case for anyone who created to works outside of storage space platform and hopefully this will already be this will already be this will be quite quite soon.

341
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:54.210
Mariusz Pisarski: I just want to finalize this section just by mentioning a few points about the future future of this of this project.

342
00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:17.790
Mariusz Pisarski: So far, we've been we've been working on it under the umbrella of electronic literature laugh, and that final product of this face would be quite at the symphony but then the next things arrives, and whatever we can build here.

343
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:36.330
Mariusz Pisarski: will be then further developed under the research grant Danielle for the next two to three years and hopefully this will turn into a tool, a writing tool, a collaborative platform.

344
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:49.890
Mariusz Pisarski: That will use the the maps and the concept of storage space in this in this new environment and beyond 2003 I think.

345
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.530
Mariusz Pisarski: This project will branch into into some.

346
00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:58.740
Mariusz Pisarski: Some flagship.

347
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:09.450
Mariusz Pisarski: flagship products of that will be then promoted within that electronic literature Center that is being founded in Poland as we speak.

348
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:32.340
Mariusz Pisarski: So it all looks that anything we do at the moment anything we do towards publication of twilight and towards building this tool for translators and authors will then live on and and inspire both offers and readers and researchers of electronic literature.

349
00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.530
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you very much and it's time for questions.

350
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:46.500
Mariusz Pisarski: And thank you very much for the chat because it's yes, thank you for all the suggestions on the chart.

351
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.630
Mariusz Pisarski: From the NIH and john Rebecca.

352
00:56:52.650 --> 00:57:06.090
Track Two: Conference Admin: marsh I came back late, but I was wondering if you could tell you a little bit more about the plans for the electronic literature Center and in Poland is that going to be Cracow based project or about.

353
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:12.480
Mariusz Pisarski: The base of the moment is, allow me to give each University in paul's nine but.

354
00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:25.740
Mariusz Pisarski: A the plans are for it to be a truly a truly a wider project not bound to any university, we would like the the.

355
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:43.740
Mariusz Pisarski: The Center to be placed in different universities at different times the Board will stay the same, and the Board will be comprised of people from all over Poland, but we also plan to have some boards from the International.

356
00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:50.190
Mariusz Pisarski: area, so we really will be just starting i'm.

357
00:57:51.600 --> 00:58:04.950
Mariusz Pisarski: At the moment at the position of Secretary of the of the research Center of that Center and as we typing it's come from other mysterious university is leading the the whole.

358
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:20.250
Mariusz Pisarski: The whole initiating and hopefully by the end of this month, we will be able to announce that the Center has been created and will be inviting people to join in for the for the ball to advise us how we can then.

359
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:22.080
Mariusz Pisarski: offer right.

360
00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:24.660
Track Two: Conference Admin: You should probably also.

361
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:31.170
Track Two: Conference Admin: get in touch with Joe tabby about the consortium for electronic literature.

362
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.910
Track Two: Conference Admin: Yes, and we talked a little bit about stuff like this, but.

363
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:40.560
Track Two: Conference Admin: It would be good for whatever sort of database or.

364
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:48.030
Track Two: Conference Admin: archive that you end up developing out of it for to go out of the box, be able to work with the soul search engine.

365
00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:54.690
Mariusz Pisarski: Absolutely, the Polish repository of it will be will be one of the first.

366
00:58:55.830 --> 00:59:00.360
Mariusz Pisarski: First, products or results of that data Center will come up.

367
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:11.730
Deena Larsen: When you have this as a writing tool which will be amazing if it's going to help.

368
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:24.450
Deena Larsen: story space has really been the only way to visualize the relationships between nodes and Alexia I think for students and that horizontal vertical.

369
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:39.690
Deena Larsen: As john mcdade was saying, 2.5 reality, you know 2.5 dimension reality is going to be huge when you have that writing space, and thank you for it, how about be distributed, how will people know about it.

370
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.050
be able to say.

371
00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:48.900
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you, thank you very much Dean, and the goals of the during up P l.

372
00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:58.230
Mariusz Pisarski: Research grant is to is to present the tools that are ready to use open source and I used in a classroom.

373
00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:05.100
Mariusz Pisarski: So this will be something that is completely open not not behind a paywall.

374
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:17.520
Mariusz Pisarski: And the collaborative collaborative potential of the tool will be tested on a group of authors, who created a Polish online collaborative fiction pieces through a.

375
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:33.810
Mariusz Pisarski: few years ago, published by heart and now the same group of people will be creating a pixels do 2.0 and they will be already working on that on this new platform.

376
01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:43.950
Mariusz Pisarski: So we can we got funding for this, and hopefully this will be, this will be one of the main results of the whole research grant.

377
01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:54.870
Mariusz Pisarski: says, an amazing opportunity to actually carry the idea of that were developed and storage space further into the into the future.

378
01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.880
Deena Larsen: it'll be wonderful i'm wondering if there's going to be any connections with twine.

379
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.660
Mariusz Pisarski: or twine at the moment is used as a prototyping.

380
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:14.820
Mariusz Pisarski: But i'm not sure about the connectivity maybe.

381
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:20.190
Mariusz Pisarski: Maybe the we might implement some import options.

382
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:29.640
Deena Larsen: yeah that might be good, and I noticed, and I put this in the chat as well on the way that you have the vision with the circular and.

383
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:47.100
Deena Larsen: The links in so very similar to what America hand off he did with the dictionary of the revolution it's beautiful and I was in touch with America, and she was like yeah our programmers would be happy to help and provide that type of javascript so.

384
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:54.450
Deena Larsen: If you need that connection, that would be great That would be a really nice interface.

385
01:01:55.290 --> 01:02:04.560
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you, thank you, this is, this is a very important work now globally and if we can cooperate with the programmers that would be fantastic.

386
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:27.570
Mariusz Pisarski: Because actually we have already feels or at times feels the pressure of being the only programmer hundred job and and definitely someone who would through some ideas or a helping hand, give a helping hand, would be very welcome great Thank you very much i'll be i'll be in touch.

387
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:36.480
Deena Larsen: Also, with this um if you guys ever when you get it, you know, in the next few years, hopefully we'll have the second Tuesday yellow salon going forever.

388
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.420
Deena Larsen: If you want to DEMO it then.

389
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.740
Deena Larsen: feel free to get a spot you know just email me for that.

390
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:45.360
Absolutely.

391
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:47.430
Mariusz Pisarski: We will.

392
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.660
Deena Larsen: it's amazing work that you're doing.

393
01:02:55.470 --> 01:03:18.120
Mariusz Pisarski: Thank you, I have actually one questions for for you, one question for you about the the path object in storage space, this is something that has been in use in in storage space one and in storage space to there was there wasn't an object called think bath right.

394
01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:32.370
Mariusz Pisarski: Apart from link title, there was a category of links that you could actually subscribe to, or name that link that you are creating or.
