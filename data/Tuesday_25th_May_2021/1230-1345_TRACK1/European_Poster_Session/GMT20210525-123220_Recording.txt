00:48:33	Scott Rettberg:	I have a question
00:53:19	Giulia Carla Rossi (she/her):	So many great presentations (and posters!) :) I have a question for Claus and the SDC4Lit team as well: are you planning on including non-browser-based digital publications in your project as well? In particular I'm thinking about Android/iOS literary apps
00:55:07	Søren Bro Pold:	I have a question.
00:55:44	Søren Bro Pold:	For Maureen and Caitlin.
00:56:51	Caitlin Fisher:	Archiving apps is a huge issue for my lab, too… trying to save both hardwares and software

01:06:45	Caitlin Fisher:	@Giulia - I do have some ideas about preserving the AR in the New Media Prize collection. It’s on my list! I do want to connect with you and your team about it.
01:07:21	Giulia Carla Rossi (she/her):	@Caitlin Please do! It would be great to get your input on it :)
