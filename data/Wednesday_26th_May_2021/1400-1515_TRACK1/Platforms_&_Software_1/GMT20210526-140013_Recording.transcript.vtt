00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:04.560
rodcoover: Seeing people.

2
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.110
Vin?cius UFMT: Okay.

3
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.360
Vin?cius UFMT: So um morning everyone.

4
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.160
Vin?cius UFMT: will start now the panel platforms and software one i'll be moderating the session and.

5
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
Vin?cius UFMT: We think of maybe each presenter speaking for five minutes.

6
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.340
Vin?cius UFMT: It.

7
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.350
Vin?cius UFMT: should have been more.

8
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.610
Vin?cius UFMT: or less that's OK, we have.

9
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.980
Vin?cius UFMT: room for accommodating and.

10
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.650
Vin?cius UFMT: Then we'll get started, and after that we will discuss and open up the mics for.

11
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.970
rodcoover: Questions comments.

12
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.360
Vin?cius UFMT: From the audience so ah, the first paper is number 34 by.

13
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.410
Vin?cius UFMT: Calling post.

14
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.350
Vin?cius UFMT: called on the platforms ruins practicing a poetics of obsolescence.

15
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.400
Colin Post: Great shape take it away.

16
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.400
rodcoover: All right.

17
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.310
Colin Post: Thank you and thank you all for.

18
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.990
Colin Post: showing up at the.

19
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.150
Colin Post: Various times of.

20
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360
Colin Post: day that it is around the world and.

21
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.370
Colin Post: So hi i'm compost assistant professor in London information science.

22
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.790
Colin Post: at university North Carolina greensboro where it's the.

23
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.430
Colin Post: Perfect time of 10am.

24
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.790
Colin Post: Perfect time for.

25
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.680
Colin Post: conference presentation, so I my paper wrote about.

26
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.340
A.

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.340
Colin Post: piece of.

28
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.510
Colin Post: Net art.

29
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.440
Colin Post: called the network.

30
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.000
Colin Post: Within a database by.

31
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.650
Colin Post: An earthquake and artists.

32
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.000
rodcoover: Brian mclaren.

33
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.400
Colin Post: And in lieu of sort of a formal.

34
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.590
Colin Post: presentation, I was going to.

35
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.950
Colin Post: share my screen and just sort of do.

36
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.630
Colin Post: A little bit of a.

37
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.660
Colin Post: overview of the.

38
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.530
piece.

39
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.950
Colin Post: And sort of highlight some of the things that I.

40
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.820
Colin Post: talked about.

41
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.450
Colin Post: In the paper and i'll throw the link.

42
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.320
Colin Post: into the chat if anyone wants to.

43
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.210
Colin Post: sort of browse.

44
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.960
along.

45
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.810
Colin Post: With me so.

46
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.120
Colin Post: I have been fascinated by this piece for.

47
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.530
Colin Post: A long time.

48
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.480
rodcoover: Basically what it is, is.

49
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.750
Colin Post: In early 2000s from.

50
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.610
Colin Post: This artist Brian mclaren.

51
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.460
Colin Post: compiled this.

52
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.350
Colin Post: database, although.

53
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.130
Colin Post: He sort of.

54
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.820
Colin Post: winky only refers to it as a database because.

55
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.280
Colin Post: Essentially, just an html.

56
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.870
Colin Post: page of.

57
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.580
Colin Post: links to.

58
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.680
rodcoover: Net art projects with.

59
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.150
Colin Post: With descriptions and specifically another art projects by.

60
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.040
Colin Post: artists from.

61
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.330
Colin Post: Latin American countries and so he was motivated to do this.

62
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.570
Colin Post: Because he was recognizing that a lot of.

63
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:46.170
Colin Post: Latina X, not our projects we're not getting talked about in the sort of mason net are just courses and.

64
00:03:47.130 --> 00:04:07.740
Colin Post: exhibitions and things like that that we're starting to show up at at this time in the late 90s early 2000s, so he compiled this this database to sort of document and create visibility and exposure for for these projects and I wrote about it as a.

65
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.930
Colin Post: it's become a kind of archive of these projects, many of which are no longer active online anymore, so if you just pick.

66
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.910
Colin Post: One at random here you'll notice that.

67
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.460
Colin Post: it's sort of a.

68
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:45.090
Colin Post: For the most part, many of these products will lead to errors like this things that are no longer publicly available the ubiquitous for a for error or projects that.

69
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.650
Colin Post: Work in some capacity but don't have the intended functionality, because they were made for really 2000s browsers and not.

70
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.300
Colin Post: 2021 browsers so this product in a way, has become a kind of archive of.

71
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.540
Colin Post: These works that that no longer.

72
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:22.200
Colin Post: Functioning anymore, and in many cases aren't even included in things like the Internet archive so I wanted to write about this project as a sort of artists driven effort to document.

73
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.900
Colin Post: Digital culture at this this critical juncture where you know lots of people were coming online.

74
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.410
Colin Post: and

75
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.470
Colin Post: sort of things that we take for granted, now or we're just sort of starting to form.

76
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:55.950
Colin Post: So a couple things that I talked about that i'll just like quickly point out, though, is that one of the reasons that this really sort of works as as an archive even though.

77
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:19.950
Colin Post: The pieces themselves are no longer active in the functional way is because it takes this kind of low tech strategy that is sort of resilient and resistant to to obsolescence so the fact that it's hand coded html that's not dependent on plugins or or other things to the function.

78
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.640
Colin Post: makes it so the the work as it was originally made in in 2000 still exists and more or less the same.

79
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:44.820
Colin Post: way that it that it did 20 years ago and so just sort of like as a as a demonstration of that I have also spun up the piece in the old web browser and you can see that it's still you know.

80
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.330
Colin Post: Aside from the interface of.

81
00:06:50.850 --> 00:07:01.290
Colin Post: But Netscape navigator browser been somewhat different than the than the current firefox browser still essentially looks the same.

82
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:15.270
Colin Post: Today, as it did 20 years ago, so be very happy to talk more about this in the discussion to follow and looking forward to the other presentations.

83
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.450
Vin?cius UFMT: Is, thank you for calling.

84
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:46.050
Vin?cius UFMT: And now we're going to move to our second presentation that would be paper 111 by roderick Hoover cold platform collaboration, creativity and determinism in virtual reality an artist paper, the making of the key to time a work for vr domes in caves.

85
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.610
rodcoover: Alright, thanks everyone I hope everyone's having a great conference it's been.

86
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.960
Vin?cius UFMT: Really fun so up.

87
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.520
rodcoover: Thanks calling for that paper also great stuff.

88
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:09.150
rodcoover: i'm going to jump into screen share and take us a little bit through the key to time and we'll look at a teeny clip very short one before we open things up and pass along to.

89
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.320
rodcoover: danny's paper so screen share here we go.

90
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.400
rodcoover: So i'm going to just start off here with.

91
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.350
rodcoover: A.

92
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:37.650
rodcoover: up well you're going to get to see it this way that, so the key to time is a 40 minutes experience, mostly for domes and a large format 360 cinema like caves.

93
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:51.750
rodcoover: environments and unfortunately it was released three days before the shutdown and March 2020 so we had a showing at the routes planetarium to launch it.

94
00:08:52.500 --> 00:09:07.650
rodcoover: And then everything else is pretty much virtual since then, the story and mostly in this paper than focus on platforms, you can read about that in more length but it's modeled after.

95
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:17.040
rodcoover: The 1920s space opera genre and it concerns a scientist who's cast 100 years into the future.

96
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:23.640
rodcoover: and less travel find a way to travel back in time to stop the world becoming the disaster, it is.

97
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:37.500
rodcoover: To express the sense of time I move between different file formats so within the vr space we have various films within films filmed in 1920s black and white silent style.

98
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:46.560
rodcoover: That hover in the space that cast in the way of past and play with a past aesthetics in this otherwise futuristic environment.

99
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:53.430
rodcoover: And is a movement between styles in between, in a way forms of filmmaking.

100
00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:06.360
rodcoover: gives a kind of perspective on settings on the different aesthetics and qualities of color immersion animation in this case, Anna who is.

101
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.240
rodcoover: The.

102
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:30.660
rodcoover: Center of this story, he is trying to get back to Adam had her hand blown off in an accident gone wrong by father was rather jealous of panics advances on his daughter and that's another side story I won't get into but she has a glass hand that has some magical powers.

103
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:45.390
rodcoover: adventure moves across time and space in place, specifically with time trying to think about how the 360 environment, the mesh used in programs like unity and blender.

104
00:10:47.190 --> 00:11:08.190
rodcoover: can be distorted to play with conventions of perspective and to move us across spaces that are both very large and very small, so we find ourselves inside clocks and other time devices inside zone tropes and other visual time devices.

105
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:24.480
rodcoover: and moving around large spaces, where our images get multiplied in this case 10 actors at a bar watching a concert as he's trying to find Adam, who is fleeing from his doppelganger.

106
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:34.560
rodcoover: The film, as I mentioned was designed for planetariums it invoke it actually includes also a lot of imagery for that I took from NASA.

107
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:50.550
rodcoover: And one of the things I thought would be interesting to discuss is this difference of shared a most of experience from a private and must have experience with vr headsets this is that a showing of the key to time in loving Ukraine.

108
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.960
rodcoover: In a vr theater where everyone is sitting there, but having their own experience a cut off from each other.

109
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:07.590
rodcoover: As I mentioned them the models included the early space opera genres.

110
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:16.530
rodcoover: And this is, in fact, our version made with space opera meaning more to do the melodramatic experience about early SCI fi.

111
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:25.350
rodcoover: But, in our case, the conditions of filming meant that I worked a lot with opera singers because we film in the large green screen with the film was made.

112
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:43.620
rodcoover: It was very advantageous to separate the sound pre recorded with vocal artists and I was in a program, the reason I started the project was that I had a Commission to do collaboration with composers, a Polish Government was setting up collaboration between artists and composers.

113
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:54.300
rodcoover: And so we took this as a kind of tongue in cheek play upon that notion, it also borrows a lot from the aesthetics of metropolis and also Andalusian dog.

114
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:07.530
rodcoover: Mostly today in the discussion, the idea is to talk about the green screen environment, this was filled in washcloth at cetera studios Center studios used to be a.

115
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:27.060
rodcoover: Great old style film studio known for films like this Eric off the manuscript classical the 1960s and it turned into animation and immersive media production studio about 10 years ago with a huge blue screen and green screen.

116
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.600
rodcoover: Designing for these spaces.

117
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:40.020
rodcoover: This is a very different kind of filmmaking one has to innocence pre planning environments, that will be sketched out in the green space.

118
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.270
rodcoover: And we built the environment, either in blender.

119
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.100
rodcoover: Or we use our backgrounds and the natural world.

120
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.020
rodcoover: But they had to be very carefully calibrated so that the imagery would match up.

121
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.530
rodcoover: We then created mockups and mock up like this of two people leaving a tower.

122
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:14.520
rodcoover: With them become the setting on which we would put also a natural it material, as well as you can see the artificial artificially created settings from blender.

123
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:26.160
rodcoover: The filming experience, therefore, was like this here is a scene in which tedx doppelganger is hiding behind is hiding by Bush.

124
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:46.080
rodcoover: You can see the green screen image on the main was being filmed can see on the bottom left what showing up as a green screen image and right next to it, the mock up of where we anticipate the Bush will be drawn when the pieces transformed.

125
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:58.050
rodcoover: Here we had markings on the floor and i'm trying to direct Ana defined right footsteps so that she will match up in the scene.

126
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:16.110
rodcoover: He has a good example of transforming one of the black and white scenes this is in the dad has just blown off and his hand, which therefore is wearing a green glove is a hand will disappear and 10 actors just walks through the door.

127
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:25.170
rodcoover: This is how the scene looks with the background put in actually The background is from our solarium here in Philadelphia.

128
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.320
rodcoover: And as dynamic and his dad and his I know with her hand gushy.

129
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.750
rodcoover: Technology wise and.

130
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:48.330
rodcoover: The filming was used done using several cameras, and this is also an interesting platform machine so, on the one hand we use 4k cameras gang together to create 3D.

131
00:15:49.170 --> 00:16:00.870
rodcoover: And these create so basically eight k's with the material, but only for small portion of the screen that has to be re contorted to fit a 360 image.

132
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.740
rodcoover: The images are accurate.

133
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:26.310
rodcoover: The rectangular image on the left in 3D is going through a wormhole and on the right, you can see the format for Dome, which is a 180 degree image, so all those images shot in standard 4k at to be reformatted to fit within these without showing any distortions.

134
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:43.020
rodcoover: The background, meanwhile, were filmed in vr where we had natural backgrounds, either with the industry pro 360 or the garmin verb I found neither of them was suitable for green screen shooting there too fuzzy they couldn't couldn't get the green out well.

135
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.890
rodcoover: So they're very nice for backgrounds, but very poor for studio work.

136
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.650
rodcoover: This, for example, is the background that we used for anna's hand.

137
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:05.880
rodcoover: background this movement of backgrounds, is another fasting aspect of of working in this platform, because one can combine imagery from.

138
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:19.050
rodcoover: All sorts of very loaded spaces and bring them into a story in this case a story that is about history and destruction, I did a lot of filming in these tunnels built by the Nazis and the Polish German border.

139
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.600
rodcoover: To talk about dangerous spaces and the nightmares or the imaginary say create.

140
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.160
rodcoover: I film tunnel see the stairs sequence in.

141
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.250
rodcoover: Military watchtower.

142
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.230
rodcoover: filmed.

143
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:50.280
rodcoover: The set of the thin these abandoned factory towns to create the dystopia of the future that is very present in fact this is in Poland Russian built factory town and Poland.

144
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.260
rodcoover: and

145
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:05.880
rodcoover: I was allowed to show a one minute clip from the film Titanic is beginning to dream.

146
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:16.080
rodcoover: he's he has a fear of being late, particularly of not being there in time for me to enter at the station.

147
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:28.140
rodcoover: And this is a little secret says he's entering into a dream imagine he's now within on one hand, is in his bunker you can see the up in the top.

148
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:35.910
rodcoover: The image of the bunker space, but he is also inside a clock.

149
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:49.890
rodcoover: I let this time be different don't be late, not this time loved you so much, if anything, should keep us apart and remember check the time.

150
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:56.250
Are you remember to check the time don't be quarter to five.

151
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:06.090
rodcoover: station when the train comes in Where are you at the tone kiss me as if the last time that time will be.

152
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.140
loved you so much.

153
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.990
One of the font all files, now the time to be once in a while.

154
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.020
once in a while now it's been a while now.

155
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.240
And then.

156
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.320
You know at the tone house and then.

157
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:35.370
will be.

158
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.770
My second again.

159
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.470
Another one.

160
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:59.760
rodcoover: In allowing more was more than more than at the tone, the at the tone, the.

161
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.480
rodcoover: Okay, and so that's a little glimpse into the.

162
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:15.240
rodcoover: Key time a 40 minute piece for domes and.

163
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.470
rodcoover: And 360 cinema and vr headsets.

164
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.860
rodcoover: released march 2020.

165
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.730
rodcoover: And the full paper discussing it is on the site and i'll pass it along Thank you.

166
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.200
Vin?cius UFMT: Thank you roderick that was.

167
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.160
Vin?cius UFMT: An amazing.

168
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.770
Vin?cius UFMT: Film and i'll pass.

169
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:38.970
It on.

170
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.820
Vin?cius UFMT: To Danny Espinosa.

171
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:48.450
Vin?cius UFMT: With the paper 125 called learning management platforms notes on teaching to record in a pandemic.

172
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.140
Dani Spinosa: hey, thank you for having me 55 cute.

173
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.240
rodcoover: minutes and.

174
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.480
Dani Spinosa: So I originally proposed as paper that I thought was going to be this like cool clothes.

175
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.480
Dani Spinosa: analytical and study of learning management systems which we are maybe too.

176
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.950
Dani Spinosa: familiar with.

177
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:16.590
Dani Spinosa: These days, and and to talk about their abilities and their shortcomings in encouraging.

178
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.990
Dani Spinosa: Non programming students, which are who.

179
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:24.780
Dani Spinosa: Who I teach to engage with code and critical and literary ways and here.

180
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.950
Dani Spinosa: Specifically i'm talking about.

181
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.700
Dani Spinosa: opera year.

182
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:38.700
Dani Spinosa: At literature students, but this is 2020 wine and things have not been turning out, as we have expected them to for a long time, so of course that's not the paper.

183
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.320
Dani Spinosa: I ended up.

184
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:47.850
Dani Spinosa: Submitting and there were a number of reasons why the paper didn't end up like I thought it was going to and the big one, was that I was creating.

185
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:57.930
Dani Spinosa: A lot alive and i'm adjunct here in southern Ontario I teach at three different institutions all remote right now and it's.

186
00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:58.530
been.

187
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:18.000
Dani Spinosa: A lot, so the paper that I ended up writing and is that paper that argues that basically that the pandemic has really laid bare several of the difficulties of precarious Labor in the academy and and let me show you limit, let me just have this baby going.

188
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.970
Dani Spinosa: wow I talked to you hold on.

189
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.720
There, she is hi.

190
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.360
Dani Spinosa: So.

191
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:37.170
Dani Spinosa: wouldn't you I when I submitted was I paper about ways I actually quite really like and a.

192
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:49.650
Dani Spinosa: Equal parts scholarly and reflective pedagogical analysis and critique of the use of the learning management system blackboard which is not what you're looking at right now for course delivery of a course called.

193
00:22:50.460 --> 00:23:01.410
Dani Spinosa: n GL 4309 digital adventures in English engaging with the digital humanities at Trent just in peterborough Ontario just a bit outside of Toronto, where I am right now.

194
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:12.960
Dani Spinosa: 4309 is a fourth year seminar and it's marketed primarily as a course in digital humanities tools, so the practical application of D H tools.

195
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:25.920
Dani Spinosa: For the study of literature and the digital literary and it was the first time that trend was able to mount it and then, when they mounted the course they found themselves without a digital humanists to instruct it so they brought me in contract.

196
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.400
Dani Spinosa: Just less than a month before the course was about to start.

197
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.840
Dani Spinosa: And one thing I did when I took on the course was.

198
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:46.110
Dani Spinosa: use to record specifically as a DHS tool so rather than making the argument that I think we no longer have to make that there's a role for a lead in D H study.

199
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:53.970
Dani Spinosa: I just situated this classic work of evil it as a tool for digital humanities research and for scholarship.

200
00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:06.750
Dani Spinosa: And in that way i'm following the quite excellent arguments made recently about the role of Elan in dh, especially those made by teeny gricar and James o'sullivan in their excellent recent publication.

201
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:16.680
Dani Spinosa: Now I know i'm preaching to the choir here, but it bears mentioning, especially as we continue remote teaching here in Toronto indefinitely.

202
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:27.090
Dani Spinosa: That the diversity of access tools and i'm talking about hardware, software and all the messy bits in between that students use to engage in their online courses.

203
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:39.840
Dani Spinosa: make the already difficult task of taking liberal arts students and getting them to mess with code even more difficult, you can't count on them to have a developer environment you can't count on them to.

204
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:58.800
Dani Spinosa: Have that hands on experience and and we have the added problem of having to use proprietary learning management systems in the courses and then try and offer these places for manipulation and programming with in those proprietary spaces.

205
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:09.960
Dani Spinosa: So when I ended up doing it is what so many of us who I like to say, put the age in dh as a an egg very much come from a humanist and not a digital or programming.

206
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.580
Dani Spinosa: perspective was I consulted a programmer.

207
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:26.460
Dani Spinosa: Who wants john or see a Toronto based programmer and a friend of mine who was able to help me share the editable code in this interface you're looking at right now J s fiddle.

208
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:34.020
Dani Spinosa: Which markets itself as a free coaching tool that allows you to edit share execute and debug web code within a browser.

209
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:43.800
Dani Spinosa: And just fiddle is marketed as a code playground and mercy and I work to take long for its original code and separated here into html javascript which was.

210
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.160
Dani Spinosa: At perhaps less scary for the students CSS with they mostly didn't touch and then it allows it to run.

211
00:25:50.640 --> 00:26:01.770
Dani Spinosa: And here in the browser and the paper that I ended up said meeting is, incidentally, not just a meditation on security and the role of the security in navigating these these.

212
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:19.200
Dani Spinosa: Issues of platform at during the pandemic, but also a kind of interesting I think close reading of the various implied audiences of these two different tools blackboard and J s fiddle this of course looking like a 90s hacker movie.

213
00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:38.040
Dani Spinosa: Free freaked out the students, a little bit at the beginning versus blackboard which is sleek easily navigable and obviously proprietary so that's the paper, I gave you and I hope you take some time to read it, because it was exhausting and fun that's all I got for you.

214
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.640
Vin?cius UFMT: Thank you Danny it's been awesome.

215
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.840
and

216
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.670
Vin?cius UFMT: So now.

217
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.670
Vin?cius UFMT: I think we can open up with discussions.

218
00:26:51.180 --> 00:27:00.270
Vin?cius UFMT: If people want to open up their minds or write in the chat or even the panelists interact with each other.

219
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.160
Vin?cius UFMT: Dean.

220
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:20.340
Dene Grigar: Thank you for the papers it's wonderful, so I mind is not a questions comment but it's interesting to start the presentations with the works that are no longer available and that archive and then to look at the most recent kind of technology is being used to produce digital storytelling.

221
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.680
Dene Grigar: and ask the question you know.

222
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.070
Dene Grigar: What.

223
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.710
Dene Grigar: what's going to happen with the worst we're producing now.

224
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:32.040
Dene Grigar: So I think it's really interesting to look at both from in the same panel, so thank you for sharing that.

225
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.480
Dene Grigar: with us.

226
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.980
Colin Post: yeah.

227
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:44.640
Colin Post: I was just thinking to me so one of the things I think that I talked about in the paper in terms of.

228
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.680
Colin Post: The network Latino database is that.

229
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:57.420
Colin Post: One of the strategies that mccarran uses is like you know just like simple description right, which is something that we're.

230
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:11.100
Colin Post: familiar with, as a kind of preservation tool throughout history right, so we have you know descriptions other artworks from earlier times I don't want to exist right but descriptions have continued to be.

231
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:28.290
Colin Post: copied over into the text, and you know through citations and things like that now, I was just noticing a kind of another sort of preservation approach happening in in terms of gorge which.

232
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.590
Colin Post: Danny wrote about of like.

233
00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:43.890
Colin Post: repetition and sort of re mixing and sort of that's another way to keep something alive right is to sort of recreate it and this these various iterations that that continue to.

234
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.930
Colin Post: To to elaborate, but of course that's also like this very text based.

235
00:28:50.370 --> 00:29:08.400
Colin Post: piece that uses, you know html and javascript and CSS like things that are relatively robust, both in terms of the ability to pick them up and deconstruct them and do things with them, but also in just that, like I don't think html and javascript and CSS are going anywhere anytime soon.

236
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:19.290
Dene Grigar: polling question did you document this and helps it, I mean everything we're doing, we should be documenting and helps that so did you take that whole just just the database itself and say this existed here the works that were listed in.

237
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.090
Colin Post: yeah I.

238
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:31.410
Colin Post: did not check to see if the database is already has already been catalogued and i'm set, but I will certainly take on that.

239
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.330
Colin Post: That citizen archivists duty and do that if it hasn't been already.

240
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.320
Scott Rettberg: yeah.

241
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:45.960
Scott Rettberg: i'm not sure if it has but also just to mention that, right now, my students are uploading all the all the papers.

242
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:55.410
Scott Rettberg: But not necessarily doing all the Cross references and things like that, so I think they're getting in touch with most with most everyone.

243
00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:14.160
Scott Rettberg: To say and say this to everyone, please do check those records add the Cross references at other works it's a really, really great opportunity to to bring these resources and make them public make them more public to people who don't know.

244
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.690
Dene Grigar: it's really important for all of us there they're talking about even just one work in our research to make sure it's in a film set.

245
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.770
Dene Grigar: And it's filled out and.

246
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.290
Dene Grigar: it's been done so, if we could all do, that it helps.

247
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.570
Dene Grigar: So many people.

248
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.760
Vin?cius UFMT: I think a lot has a question as well.

249
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:43.740
Carlota Salvador Megias: Okay, for me to talk now I thought the the panelists we're gonna talk to each other, first I don't mind waiting.

250
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:46.710
rodcoover: jump in I think.

251
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:59.160
Carlota Salvador Megias: yeah okay um so i'm quite new to this field so um maybe some of the things that interest me are a bit more on the on the baseline superficial level but um I really enjoyed reading your paper.

252
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:11.040
Carlota Salvador Megias: Calling post and your discussion of go do novus experiments and aesthetic organization, on page six made me think about the aesthetics of informatics more generally.

253
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:22.560
Carlota Salvador Megias: And how much aesthetic considerations influence informatics choices in general, and I was wondering if I could just get your general thoughts and anybody else's who's interested.

254
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:36.450
Carlota Salvador Megias: On some of the advantages and pitfalls that you see in this kind of relationship between like a person's aesthetic sensibilities and correctional intentions and, like the goals of informatics.

255
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.110
Colin Post: yeah no that's that's really interesting.

256
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:56.400
Colin Post: And I was really thrilled to see that Olga will be giving a keynote and a couple of days, so if you didn't see that, on the schedule the the person I cited.

257
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.800
Colin Post: That you're referring to is going to be.

258
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.820
Colin Post: Giving a keynote think Friday that right.

259
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:06.930
Colin Post: But the question.

260
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:17.400
Colin Post: So I think there's a lot of interesting things that could be further explored about sort of like discussions happening around like data visualization and.

261
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:26.490
Colin Post: those sorts of conversations that are happening more in the sort of like data science data analytic spheres and things happening in digital humanities and.

262
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:43.410
Colin Post: And Isla because, obviously, we have a lot of experience, like with visualizing information in different ways, although for often different purposes right for to engender a kind of aesthetic experience, rather than to to analyze something or pull something out.

263
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.960
Colin Post: Yes, Sir, more like a general question.

264
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.280
Colin Post: Our general comment.

265
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.070
Colin Post: I don't know.

266
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.480
Colin Post: I mean, one of the things that's interesting with.

267
00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.250
Colin Post: With how Korea Nova.

268
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:06.630
Colin Post: sort of fear arises and aesthetics of organization, though, is it that it's not happening on an individual level it's sort of this.

269
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:27.060
Colin Post: emergent thing that's happening between lots of people that are involved in like putting a platform together and all the different sort of strands but, but human and technical that are coming together so there's almost not it's almost for for how she theorizes sort of.

270
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:34.470
Colin Post: In organizational subjects there's not really an ability to take a sort of big picture overview and sort of make.

271
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:44.400
Colin Post: Those kinds of those kinds of decisions that a lot of things are sort of emerging and just sort of dependent on sort of how things fit together.

272
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:56.070
Colin Post: So i'm just kind of rambling at this point, but i'll invite other panelists to to step into additional thoughts.

273
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.920
Vin?cius UFMT: i'm mmm hmm I think Sarin has a question as well, we had written in the chat.

274
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.090
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): yeah.

275
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:32.670
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): My I guess my question follows a bit on from what Dini talked about, but in a different way.

276
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:41.280
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): The sort of historic sizing and the historical technologies in the historical works that both Colin.

277
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:53.130
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): touches on by talking about the works that have disappeared and yeah in a way of documenting their obsolescence right and and and and rot.

278
00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.350
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): Of course, your piece also showed this sort of.

279
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:08.700
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): You definitely play a lot with media history and the archaeology and also the historical clocks the soul drop sets up a panoramic.

280
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.610
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): dimensions.

281
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.260
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): So so so my question would be more.

282
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:35.280
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): On on on how do you see these lesions what does it mean to use historical technology or what does it mean to why are you interested in this historical technologies historical media what what are their effects.

283
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:43.290
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): Currently, or or you know what do they pointed in the contemporary.

284
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.470
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): rock you.

285
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.620
rodcoover: can start off with that seagull else wants to.

286
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.220
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): jump in.

287
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.610
rodcoover: I think so many people also who are out there in the audience like.

288
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:15.270
rodcoover: are involved in a similar practice of looking at correspondences to our current media to different kinds of media, not just the one that came right before it.

289
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.360
rodcoover: Early on, really in our.

290
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:37.470
rodcoover: The rise of hypertext writing and media in the 90s it already has so much focus on the relationship of the web page to the medieval manuscript and then to panoramic representation, with the rise of early quick time.

291
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:44.130
rodcoover: The only quicktime vr panoramic works of the turn of the millennium.

292
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:57.120
rodcoover: In 19th century technologies of panorama and how vision is shaped and how, in a way different kind of perspective growth and also in a way, how those technologies.

293
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:13.920
rodcoover: tackled questions of spatial movement and spatial logic in relationship to time in different ways, and these topics, whether what I as a filmmaker first and be starting in film and coming into other media forms.

294
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.460
rodcoover: was so dominant in early cinema when their early cinema was tackling the question of how does film make time.

295
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:31.470
rodcoover: create these strange imagine world that transports people in ways that hadn't really happened quite the same way with the cut.

296
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:43.560
rodcoover: and speeding motion slowing motion and so so many of the questions that come up again in our current media come up with the birth of each of these other forms.

297
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:55.170
rodcoover: and early cinema, the questions in a way, many questions that became forgotten with the rise of dominant genres are hanging out there, and now the cinema and our wonderful.

298
00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:09.810
rodcoover: Issues to exploit in the days of early cinema when cinema was really just a fairground amusement element, they didn't know what to do with it, it was rivaled with all of these other motion image technologies like this zoetrope.

299
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:21.030
rodcoover: And, and these are all part of in a way, a plethora you know the sort of mix of of time fragment elements that were were you know wasn't really a domination.

300
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:31.170
rodcoover: And it's quite an interesting counterpart to play with this counterpart of these different ways of time it's sliced up spaces are thrown together that was happening, then.

301
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:38.370
rodcoover: So on that, on the one hand they're interesting correspondences, on the other hand, there are things that are a unique to this.

302
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:54.030
rodcoover: These current technologies of vr immersive technologies as as well, of course, they are in any other, but we are is is is really not cinema, but it uses so much of the technology maps on so perfectly with cinema.

303
00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:04.200
rodcoover: That it creates this wonderful junction disjunctions because what's still working with video editing software in 360 cinema.

304
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:10.470
rodcoover: And outputs just like film and yet there are so many things actually within that so very different.

305
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:18.390
rodcoover: So there's a in a way the gaps, there are perhaps portals for us.

306
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.520
rodcoover: In storytelling.

307
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.550
Colin Post: From.

308
00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.670
Colin Post: sovereigns question.

309
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:43.740
Colin Post: That I kind of brought to mind another question that I wanted to propose to Danny about this, one that i've been thinking about as well, of like.

310
00:39:45.630 --> 00:40:01.050
Colin Post: How to sort of if we're incorporating historical works of Isla into classes, how to sort of put students in touch with like technologies that are maybe.

311
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:12.090
Colin Post: The older technologies that were used in in these works right and the sort of challenge of doing that mediated through a learning management system.

312
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.830
Colin Post: So yeah you have any thoughts Danny about how you might approach that like.

313
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.410
Colin Post: Through the sort of.

314
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:31.260
Colin Post: Learning management online class, how are you I put students in touch with like older technologies.

315
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:42.330
Dani Spinosa: yeah it's a good question when i'm still kind of working on, I think it's like a double edged sword, on the one hand.

316
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:52.500
Dani Spinosa: Students, especially young students these days have this idea that if the tech looks old and they have ideas of white lake or.

317
00:40:52.950 --> 00:41:03.360
Dani Spinosa: Like 90s or early 2000s tech looks like and it can be a kind of empowering experience, especially for students who are liberal arts students who don't know how to do this they have this idea, which is both.

318
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:21.150
Dani Spinosa: True, and not true that the tech is more simple, and so there'll be able to go back and look through and understand and grasp on to little parts i'm always a bit concerned about it, turning into that i'm students having to cater to professor's nostalgia.

319
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:29.220
Dani Spinosa: which I think one student wants told me they were told to watch the Princess bride before going to.

320
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:39.810
Dani Spinosa: Before going to college, so that they could get their students or their proper references and so a worry it's going to become something like that, where they're constantly kind of cake is that's horrible right.

321
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:51.810
Dani Spinosa: And I am guilty of it, I will admit i'm by lake you, you have to walk that line between I get a little nervous I got all up in my field, looking at that Netscape.

322
00:41:52.260 --> 00:42:01.890
Dani Spinosa: emulator already I was like oh like it feels so nice and you have to be careful, because the whole point when I talk about it in my paper is the whole point of this.

323
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:12.510
Dani Spinosa: is for it to be empowering this this process of getting an undergrad an English teacher English teacher to mess, with a little javascript for a moment should be empowering.

324
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.280
Dani Spinosa: him and you run the risk of.

325
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:20.700
Dani Spinosa: course of oh that's so far outside of me, so I don't have an answer I have lots of problems and i'm navigating.

326
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.020
Vin?cius UFMT: I have a question for donnie.

327
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:46.200
Vin?cius UFMT: As she said that she works with prospective English teachers right students who don't have much background and coding and other tech skills like that, do you think that the challenge.

328
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:59.280
Vin?cius UFMT: Is of teaching them elite business that require coding is different in remote teaching and in face to face teaching, do you think that difference affects the pedagogical process.

329
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:08.430
Dani Spinosa: It does it, there are some good benefits and some problems I can't.

330
00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:16.530
Dani Spinosa: it's a lot harder for me to be right there with them scrolling through or just answering a quick question like that.

331
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:24.120
Dani Spinosa: and making sure they're like that's why I liked js settle as a workaround was because I could just send them a link and suddenly they were in.

332
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:32.190
Dani Spinosa: They were in the code, they were watching it run so for someone who I can't yeah they don't have developer environments, they don't know how to even find.

333
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:50.310
Dani Spinosa: The source code they don't understand like literally they were like I can't look at the Code, the second I see like square brackets i'm going to start freaking out so i'm to kind of ease them into it, I thought the workaround was useful but there's a lot of.

334
00:43:51.450 --> 00:44:02.580
Dani Spinosa: can do it on their own time I wasn't there you know watching them in a while, but they weren't feeling stressed about that, so they could go back and review the material kind of on their own time.

335
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:15.270
Dani Spinosa: If i'm being totally honest I had maybe a 50% I actually tried this rate and if 50% know the code is scary rate, and I think that's pretty good I was happy.

336
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:27.330
Patrick Lichty: Danny I have a question is that this is really interesting what you're talking about as that, so the thing here at winona state.

337
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:32.520
Patrick Lichty: When i'm you know, having come over from Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi and you know hanging out with the guys here.

338
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:42.090
Patrick Lichty: Is that we're looking at the idea of how we can, how we can start getting students involved media and different narrative structures, the one thing that i'm looking at here.

339
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.970
Patrick Lichty: Is that i've worked extensively with 1978 slow scan TV equipment.

340
00:44:48.420 --> 00:45:02.010
Patrick Lichty: So the thing is i'm asking and The thing is, I want to look have them be working with time based narrative structures, using one frame every seven seconds, you know at 120 pixels by you know.

341
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:14.010
Patrick Lichty: For color is all that, I mean this is really, really to in their mind crude stuff, but do you think that there's an event horizon in which there's a different differentiation between the style.

342
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:26.340
Patrick Lichty: And what I would say is that a sin chronic alien this you know what I made was idea so so say, for example in Korea Archangel in his piece, you know super.

343
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:33.750
Patrick Lichty: super Mario clouds he was going back for false nostalgia, but the thing is, I feel like you know, sometimes that you go back.

344
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:43.710
Patrick Lichty: Further, yet you wind up almost in sort of like in the students of the millennium kind of like a vern Jules verne like sort of.

345
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.370
Patrick Lichty: You know retro cyberpunk sort of world in which.

346
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:55.440
Patrick Lichty: is like oh my God, what is this thing this is this, you know, this might as well be a scary univac you know, like what the hell do I do with this and.

347
00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:13.380
Patrick Lichty: The thing is, in the unfamiliarity the alien this of old retro retro tech, you know i'm wondering whether there's you know this this line between how far back, can you go till you break with you know these ideas that you're talking about and then it gets into like a retro tech.

348
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:26.940
Dani Spinosa: mm hmm um I think it's going to depend it's going to depend on the group and their familiarity with the tech and and what else you're building on in the class.

349
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:34.530
Dani Spinosa: I like I can't tell you how many times like i'm like obsessed with that scene in the net where Sandra bullock orders by pizza from her.

350
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:41.190
Dani Spinosa: from her balance and like obsessed with my moment and I was trying to talk to them about it and trying to be like like.

351
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:49.140
Dani Spinosa: Like indiana Jones style media archaeologist now and being like look at how amazing this is and they they didn't understand.

352
00:46:49.800 --> 00:47:04.320
Dani Spinosa: How to sit like you need a kind of media history class in order to have them be able to situate that as a weird moment of nostalgia for that to be a strange interesting thing, so I don't know I mean I.

353
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.140
Dani Spinosa: You lose content yeah.

354
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:07.440
Patrick Lichty: I mean.

355
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.090
Patrick Lichty: yeah there was a point in which.

356
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:19.710
Patrick Lichty: You know there's there's a point in which the students have kind of an idea of a context but The thing is, I think back beyond the event horizon that context, no longer exists and that's where the challenges I think.

357
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:30.570
rodcoover: that's a beautiful thing too is that each of those moments is also, in a way, you know if there is no future known each technology, you know if you're in the moment where you can imagine, the future of that technology.

358
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:38.670
rodcoover: Not becoming what it became but jumping from we do a lot of hand painted film I do a lot of hand painted hand scratching film in class.

359
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:51.690
rodcoover: With students go from hand painting on celluloid into digital images if TV never happened or the rest of film never happened, and the way you should these technologies with a lot of fun video working with all video is totally like that too.

360
00:47:52.320 --> 00:48:01.470
rodcoover: And there's something about just cutting out in the middle, that is, opens up lots of things if they can like play with monitors that have you know, really.

361
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:12.000
rodcoover: funky old resolution lines and go straight from that into a different thing and the way it's so it's it's hard to get rid of the aesthetic of the last year.

362
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:22.770
rodcoover: Whatever that last year is so something really beautiful right show your students psycho charged in a different way, once they can work with some something other than the most recent stuff.

363
00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:28.290
Patrick Lichty: yeah The one thing I love is I love it I just I just showed them this stuff and I just say this became Skype.

364
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.430
Patrick Lichty: And they're just what what you know.

365
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:40.680
Patrick Lichty: I mean this became zoom actually sort of you know i'm the end they're just going like what you know.

366
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.700
Colin Post: This is something that comes up in.

367
00:48:52.440 --> 00:49:08.310
Colin Post: My classes as well, but from a slightly different angle that I kind of wanted to throw in so I teach in a library information science department so students can master's degrees that want to go work in libraries, or for archives and museums so.

368
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.470
Colin Post: In enact.

369
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:23.730
Colin Post: For that, like for that student group I really stress like history of technology history, information technology as like a core sort of area of knowledge that they need to come away with.

370
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:39.480
Colin Post: And maybe that's that's a term that I feel like i'm going to be going alone in my department, sometimes it's like such a focus on like innovation and like always like just knowing like the newest thing which is going to become historical five years from now, anyway.

371
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.160
Colin Post: So I feel like students that are going to go work in those.

372
00:49:45.180 --> 00:50:00.300
Colin Post: In those cultural heritage institutions, especially those that are going to work in archives that needs that are going to be working with older materials and sort of being the ones that are responsible for providing the context to to researchers or audiences.

373
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.560
Colin Post: That you really need that sort of media history technology history.

374
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:13.950
Colin Post: skill set and, of course, that you know that was just kind of alluding to that feeds into you know.

375
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.640
Colin Post: People approaching those questions from.

376
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:28.110
Colin Post: The perspective of researcher because you're Mr the library into sort of the intermediary that's helping that researcher to to understand that that context.

377
00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.140
Colin Post: For like the item that they're using as well.

378
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:54.390
Colin Post: And so there.

379
00:50:56.370 --> 00:51:02.700
Colin Post: Are other questions from the audience that that another sort of different direction that we can take the conversation and.

380
00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.580
Colin Post: So one thing that I was thinking.

381
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:10.470
Colin Post: me about.

382
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:19.350
Colin Post: Your paper, and as you were talking about your paper this morning and something that i've thought about too is like how.

383
00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:30.390
Colin Post: How dependent we're becoming on these like corporate platforms and technologies, and I think that's sort of a theme that's running throughout throughout this conference is one of the themes of the conference.

384
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:33.870
Colin Post: And this, especially like so.

385
00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:53.190
Colin Post: kind of antithetical returned to historical perhaps overlay nostalgic lens and medical to like you know the the ethos of of the early web where the goal was for things to be open and yield understandable by by people that were using it for the first time.

386
00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:56.730
Colin Post: That, but you know.

387
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:02.940
Colin Post: i'm just sort of wondering like what is the what is the leverage that we have to sort of push back against that.

388
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:16.110
Colin Post: Or you know how do we avoid just becoming complicit in using these like corporate learning management platforms and web conferencing platforms.

389
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.200
Colin Post: And all this stuff I don't know.

390
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:32.730
Dani Spinosa: God I wish I had I wish I had a good answer for you, the truth is, like the the background why I ended up coming to the paper, I take with us as part of that.

391
00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:44.430
Dani Spinosa: and digital humanities class I kind of grounded everything into this debate and we're David Columbia and and whoever else in that the article about neo liberal tools.

392
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:58.020
Dani Spinosa: And then Matthew Christian bombs blog response to that and and to talk about in ground our study of digital humanity in on the one hand, not like becoming some kind of Lake.

393
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:09.390
Dani Spinosa: A Narco primitivism or like Live eight in the English department and refusing that person, but on the other hand, not kind of neglecting the corporatization which I think I really.

394
00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:21.450
Dani Spinosa: Like i'm, not that I want to like be the adjunct about harps on it, because I get that bad gets annoying but, like you really get an interesting perspective of that corporatization and, as you as you get kind of JET.

395
00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:34.080
Dani Spinosa: jumbled from department to department and you have to get fluent in these different proprietary platforms and and move across them thoughtfully and.

396
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:43.680
Dani Spinosa: I see, I mean obviously being familiar with what kinds of non proprietary tech are available to you and can be.

397
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:52.080
Dani Spinosa: can be circulated to your students is one good way around it and the truth is as like a literary scholar first thing never would have known about.

398
00:53:52.530 --> 00:54:05.190
Dani Spinosa: Like all my experience of coding is in proprietary developer environments that's, the only thing i've ever ever used or learned in so you kind of need to be in the 90s.

399
00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:23.070
Dani Spinosa: hacker underground that still exists in some ways for sure and otherwise, like the the university, I think, is is is corporate has been corporate will be corporate my classes my classes all.

400
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:35.220
Dani Spinosa: Copyright zoom copyright you jerk copyright black or copyright bright space like that's just how i'm going to be teaching it's how we're all teaching I don't know if there's a way.

401
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:43.920
Dani Spinosa: Around that and we can get bummed out about that, and we would, if we went out for drinks, as we should be after this but.

402
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.840
Dani Spinosa: we'll do it at home.

403
00:54:46.320 --> 00:55:02.250
rodcoover: yeah the whole nfc thing where is also part of this, you know massive land grab taking place and to what degree can enough if everyone else grab you bet it, but then grab as it work because there's nothing left feeling or how do you carve out some of the space, on the other hand.

404
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:12.540
rodcoover: The you know constant activism made by people having small tools and circumventing the system still is still happening so there's something beautiful about the amount of.

405
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:23.880
rodcoover: Things that are done because people are out there with with a cell phones a little cameras on note taking devices and able to put stuff up and put stuff out still well that stay I don't know but.

406
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:37.470
rodcoover: There is that there is something else about how the machine targets that information that I think needs to be addressed, a sort of a in a, how do you shut off the kind of political madness, a lot of time, a lot of that is.

407
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:50.280
rodcoover: These engines determining what we want to see, rather than being allowed to do that and be allowed to just funnel constantly funnel this the same again the same again the same again 10 people down rabbit holes.

408
00:55:50.940 --> 00:56:02.670
rodcoover: And that is something that needs to be addressed with activism, and the action political change that can be changed rules can be changed, that would change our political dynamic a lot.

409
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:09.960
rodcoover: and give a lot of a lot more choice because right now, that is, the illusion of choice and often rather choice.

410
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:12.420
seems to me.

411
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.610
Vin?cius UFMT: And I think seven has another question.

412
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:21.390
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): yeah it kind of relates.

413
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.080
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): To this discussion.

414
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:32.370
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): And maybe it goes to call in here because because you also work with stuff from the sort of.

415
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:41.310
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): Early early net right and and and and, for instance, somebody like really nice his work with this idea of the.

416
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:51.300
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): of how you know how people were commonly designing the early network, and you know and the spirit of net culture that time.

417
00:56:51.990 --> 00:57:05.550
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): And and and, of course, my question is also, and it also relates to the question I have before is is is is some kind of solution in historical technologies or, at least in the thinking that was part of.

418
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:12.660
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): You know when when when take technology was still utopian before it all became Facebook and soon.

419
00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:25.080
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): You know other other because, because I feel we are, we are, we are this moment that also spoke about at the opening where you know we locked down in these squares and.

420
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:42.780
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): And like we for this contract we even had to buy a commercial soon, because our you know the corporate soon version that our university provides that has been a privacy, we couldn't even get that to work for our purposes, so you know we locked down in this.

421
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:50.460
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): yeah and these platforms and we need a way out, and I was just thinking you know can history hills.

422
00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:59.550
Patrick Lichty: Sarin do you think that do you think that we could go back to inhabiting the still existent Cree web spaces of the net to do this, like the US net.

423
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:07.110
S?ren Bro Pold (he, him): Well, in some sense, maybe we can, but of course we have to do it in a new way right.

424
00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:07.710
course.

425
00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:11.430
Colin Post: yeah now I mean, I think that that's.

426
00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:20.880
Colin Post: Definitely sort of historical perspectives media political perspectives can help I mean as sort of the one of the driving.

427
00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:26.220
Colin Post: motivations are sort of sort of underlying.

428
00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:36.990
Colin Post: sort of undergirds a sort of theory methodology of New York media archaeology right is that history history of technology is not a linear.

429
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.540
Colin Post: trajectory of progress right.

430
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.370
Colin Post: there's sort of these.

431
00:58:44.760 --> 00:59:00.660
Colin Post: These resonances and sort of cycles and loops and you know we often sort of circle back to things that were that were ahead of their time or didn't work in one context, but now can be sort of rehabilitated to to talk again in a new context.

432
00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.880
Colin Post: So yeah I think that that's you know overall for.

433
00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:12.930
Colin Post: For for media historians people studying studying older.

434
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:18.210
Colin Post: Examples of digital art and culture, and one of the reasons that i'm you know.

435
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.470
Colin Post: really like to study the work of of.

436
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:38.550
Colin Post: Artists and writers, is using these technologies is that they're often the ones that are sort of surfacing these ideas of how we can use some sort of system or platform in a way that wasn't maybe how was initially intended, but can sort of point toward.

437
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:51.180
Colin Post: alternative uses or alternative trajectories so so definitely yes, I mean, I think the question is, what do we, how do we leverage that sort of historical understanding.

438
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.630
Colin Post: into into real change, so I mean, can we be advocating for like.

439
00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:07.980
Colin Post: You know government action to sort of adopt some sort of platform or technology and subsidize it in a way that will make it.

440
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:18.270
Colin Post: make it more feasible, I mean there's an example here in North Carolina of a town Wilson North Carolina but they have their own.

441
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:31.050
Colin Post: Internet company that's a city utility that has since been sort of like lobbied against by Internet companies and it's no longer possible for other towns North Carolina to do.

442
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:40.770
Colin Post: As long as like the law standards that's the way they are, but they're sort of examples like that right of like you know, making the Internet, a public utility.

443
01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:49.080
Colin Post: You know I think it's it's things that we understand are technically possible do we have like the sort of like social, political will to to achieve them.
