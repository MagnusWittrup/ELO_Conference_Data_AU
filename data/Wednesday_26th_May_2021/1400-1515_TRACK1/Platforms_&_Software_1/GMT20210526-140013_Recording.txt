00:13:57	Track Two: Conference Admin:	With sound next time :-)
00:16:00	Colin Post:	http://netart.org.uy/latino/index.html
00:16:41	Dene Grigar:	Love the ascii art
00:17:19	Vinícius UFMT:	Interesting to see the map "upside down" in ASCII
00:17:24	Dene Grigar:	yes
00:19:14	Dene Grigar:	Tracing the trajectory of the artists following the publication of their work here would be fascinating
00:20:48	Dene Grigar:	It would be interesting to cross reference these artist in The Museum of the Essential
00:31:53	Dene Grigar:	The imagery is gorgeous, Rod
00:33:50	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	Amazing!
00:33:51	Dene Grigar:	which headsets?
00:33:54	CLARA CHETCUTI:	So fascinating how VR allows for such virtuousic  play with scale
00:34:00	Alessia Pannese:	Applause!
00:40:08	Alessia Pannese:	thank you !
00:42:11	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	Q
00:45:50	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	Yes Olga is on Friday.
00:47:17	Carlota Salvador Megias:	thank you!
00:50:28	Jeremy Hight:	exactly  my work on creating locative narrative was inspired by land art, the situationists and old maps
00:50:40	Dene Grigar:	Jeremy +1
00:52:34	Dene Grigar:	Cinema has influenced much of contemporary media art
00:54:47	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	Thanks, I think it also relates to the situation we’ve had during the last year, that we’re still trying to grasp. Both our relations to media/platforms and to spaces.
00:54:55	Roberta Iadevaia:	netstalgia
00:55:08	Dene Grigar:	Roberta +! :)
00:56:05	CLARA CHETCUTI:	What Rod was talking about reminded me a lot of balloonist Thomas Baldwin's Airopaidia: The Narrative of a Balloon excursion which included some beautiful 18th centuries panoramic colour plates
00:57:28	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	Clara, this sounds interesting. Obviously the possibility of flying, photographing and creating mediated visibility are related.
00:57:53	CLARA CHETCUTI:	I'm working on sending you images of the plates. Yes it's super interesting that we've always had this desire to mediate perspective
00:58:19	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	JSfiddle is a great solution to that problem. When I (attempt) similar things in class, I lose at least one class session explaining text editors -- so the fun part (working with the code) takes so long to get to that it's hard for students to get
01:01:44	Jeremy Hight:	had a few excellent zoom discussions with my dtc students about this this term...they got excited discussing the resonance of older forms and the line between aesthetics, function and breaking set/remixing
01:02:41	Patrick Lichty:	Definitely.
01:02:51	Dene Grigar:	+1 We have ELL, Jeremy, where many of them have been able pre-pandemic to play with the legacy computers and game consoles
01:03:09	Jeremy Hight:	awesome yes
01:03:55	Jeremy Hight:	one student made a narrative in Minecraft  where everything the character explored turned to stone..was great
01:07:37	Vinícius UFMT:	This discussion of precarization of academic work reminds me of a poster presented in the 1st day: https://eliterature.org/elo2021/posters/pdf/Tenure_Track.pdf
01:07:42	Vinícius UFMT:	"It's Tenure Track: a Professor Simulatora and a critical simulation game"
01:07:48	Patrick Lichty:	I am currently considering the non-corporate internet spaces as narratological spaces, like Usenet (which still exists) :)
01:08:33	Christine Wilks:	There are more and more HTML CSS JavaScript web development tools available on the open web
01:08:35	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	Another Question if there’s time
01:08:47	Dene Grigar:	+1 christine
01:08:57	Jeremy Hight:	it is fascinating to now digitally spelunk the vacant university sites in second life
01:09:11	Patrick Lichty:	Jeremy hight’s subversive NFT E-Lit.
01:10:23	Christine Wilks:	The open web community is also getting better and better at providing learning materials and courses - all free - e.g. MDN, web.dev
01:11:03	Melinda White (she/her):	Knightlab has a variety of tools that are easy to use (and free).
