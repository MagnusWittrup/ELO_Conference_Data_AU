annie: We are atomics.

6
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:58.680
annie: We will discuss the performance, we did yesterday and our whole research and performance project that started in I think November 2019 or something like that.

7
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.830
annie: We have prepared a little bit and to be.

annie: And the last 20 minutes, maybe even longer, we will come to this back to we won't be in zoom anymore, and we will go right and go with you and try to answer questions.

15
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.680
Curt Cloninger: and

16
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.510
annie: comfort in that way.

17
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.970
Daniel Pinheiro: Maybe I will just add a.

18
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.180
link to the Sam Apache the speakers to.

19
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.510
Daniel Pinheiro: Whatever it's been live stream, so that people are watching online, you can also join.

20
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.620
Curt Cloninger: Any when you share your screen, you could put it in a text document that will get archived in the video.

21
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.330
Curt Cloninger: So that even later if there's no chat yeah but then we won't be talking on the from appeared later.

22
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.440
annie: yeah that's nope I can share it now for five seconds, just to sell people can find it okay.

23
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.530
annie: That might be a good time.

24
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.340
I hope it works see.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.480
there's no audio So do you see it.

26
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.120
annie: Can you see the link.

annie: We plan to show you.

38
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.590
annie: Two or three minutes of yesterday's performance, that is for people who are not.

39
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.250
annie: allowed or not capable of coming.

40
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.040
annie: I think I do that now.

41
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.700
annie: And I will share again.

42
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.500
annie: My screen, but now I will do it with the audio.

43
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.320
See.

44
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.640
King King King King King King King King King King the.

45
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.590
King.

46
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.560
King king.

47
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.080
King King King a king.

48
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.780
Cut cut cut cut.

49
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.740
Curt Cloninger: it's difficult for me to rewatch.

50
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.120
Curt Cloninger: It must be done um.

51
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:47.190
Curt Cloninger: So i'll start talking and then it will just be us talking as it proceeds the promise of this panel was toward a supra semiotic telepresence communication and in the description, it was promised some.

52
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.730
Curt Cloninger: reference to the theorists the literary theorists Mikhail buxton.

53
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.470
Curt Cloninger: And he has the theory of the utterance that's.

54
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.970
Curt Cloninger: I would say, central to his his.

55
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.410
Curt Cloninger: Whole.

56
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.900
Curt Cloninger: All of his writing.

57
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.630
Curt Cloninger: And briefly it's there and the from a pad the the button quotes that I find most relevant.

58
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.390
Curt Cloninger: That briefly, he says.

59
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.370
Curt Cloninger: That the live utterance of that is this.

60
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.810
Curt Cloninger: Crucial node in the evolution of language.

61
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.720
Curt Cloninger: brockton doesn't believe.

62
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:48.300
Curt Cloninger: Like a semi out petition like Noam Chomsky buxton doesn't believe that language is a series of systems and grammars and words on a page he's saying languages.

63
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.100
Curt Cloninger: At least two parts one is that.

64
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.860
Curt Cloninger: Those words on the page and all the grammar rules, but the other is.

65
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:10.680
Curt Cloninger: lived contextual utterances, so people ordering coffee people talking to each other at the grocery store husbands and wives arguing even people reading.

66
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.530
Curt Cloninger: When I read a book that is an utterance when the book sits on the shelf, it is not altering and what happens according to brockton is.

67
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.910
Curt Cloninger: As the utterance event occurs.

68
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.260
Curt Cloninger: You would understand that language enters into.

69
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:41.550
Curt Cloninger: lived human space time, but what he says also happens is the language that's on the page all the grammar rules, all the syntax it gets changed itself during the utterance event.

70
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:53.190
Curt Cloninger: because every time I use the word love I think differently about the word love and as this word is used all over the world every day that word changes in meaning every day.

71
00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:10.530
Curt Cloninger: And so, in a sense, everyone in every language is evolving the language, based on lyft contextual utterances that without this utterance event language doesn't change and so.

72
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.890
Curt Cloninger: He also says that there are certain.

73
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:33.960
Curt Cloninger: He calls these technical accidents almost that get folded into language in the utterance if i'm reading a book at a coffee house and the coffee tastes particularly hot, then the words i'm reading them.

74
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:52.680
Curt Cloninger: change a little bit in meaning due to that if the typography is in Helvetica rather than times new Roman if as i'm talking i'm waving my arms a lot all of these live defective non semiotic things.

75
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.840
Curt Cloninger: Through the utterance event cover language and change it.

76
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.300
Curt Cloninger: And he says the utterances, a very important note in.

77
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.320
Curt Cloninger: Communication and language and so with this project we get together online.

78
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:22.140
Curt Cloninger: Where we're not smelling each other we're in different time zones at different levels of tired we're in different air conditioned or non air conditioned environment.

79
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:32.760
Curt Cloninger: And then zoom is glitches and dropping and stuttering and breaking up and all these things are part of the lived utterance event.

80
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.040
Curt Cloninger: Yesterday the context of the way in which our performance started was part of the.

81
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:56.250
Curt Cloninger: We were part of the introduction of the conference and then Ian said something, and there we were at other performances it doesn't start That way we just dropped straight into I saw being on the frame and then we try to listen to each other.

82
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.220
Curt Cloninger: Whether in real time or a call and response.

83
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:10.620
Curt Cloninger: And sometimes we speak words French words and Portuguese words in English words and.

84
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.880
Curt Cloninger: It sounds like sometimes they're speaking Japanese words.

85
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:22.230
Curt Cloninger: Sometimes, so it sounds like someone they speak German words but who knows, but the idea is.

86
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:35.010
Curt Cloninger: What would happen if we got together in a tuned ourselves to each other and to the moment and began a series of other things that were not.

87
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.410
Curt Cloninger: solely drawing on the history of our human spoken languages, but we're responding.

88
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:51.630
Curt Cloninger: bodily and someone else could perhaps could talk about the the triggers and the attainments.

89
00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:08.400
Curt Cloninger: So these are just tricks that we use to get ourselves prepared for this event but it's always improvisational this is maybe the eighth one we've done, I believe we've done some conferences, where other people have have participated.

90
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:19.590
Curt Cloninger: And it's a research project so yesterday felt like a performance, I think, because of the context of the conference or something, but sometimes it just feels like a private conversation.

91
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:30.330
Curt Cloninger: Sometimes it's very calm sometimes it's very musical sometimes it's more it sounds more like speaking, sometimes it sounds like a.

92
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.730
room noises.

93
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.970
Curt Cloninger: But rather than sort of coming with a predetermined idea of what it's going to be.

94
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:46.320
Curt Cloninger: We come with a kind of readiness to see what what will happen and and so for.

95
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:54.990
Curt Cloninger: Each one is more or less different, but there are similarities so that's my introduction, and I will stop talking now.

96
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.270
Curt Cloninger: That may be able would make sense to talk about.

97
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.700
Curt Cloninger: The triggers.

98
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.610
Curt Cloninger: or anyone can talk about what they want.

99
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.670
Nerina Cocchi: Go Danny.

100
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.370
Daniel Pinheiro: yeah I was, I was gonna add to cart sad about I think.

101
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.760
Daniel Pinheiro: I think it's better if we like start engaging some sort of conversation I think that's how we know how to do it.

102
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.960
Daniel Pinheiro: But I was going to speak about the tournament.

103
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:53.220
Daniel Pinheiro: Like the preparation that we make, I think, I think that that puts us all, even though we're all like card said.

104
00:12:54.090 --> 00:13:05.400
Daniel Pinheiro: Natural living in different places and we're all connecting here and are already doing with all the transformation that that the digital space is doing to our own sounds.

105
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:16.740
Daniel Pinheiro: But we all come into it with with with the same frame of mind, because we all listen to a piece or to work before each.

106
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:40.770
Daniel Pinheiro: Each encounter I rather call them encounter is very experienced this this this way of communicating between between us all and and and, yes, the context changes, but I think that that that plays a very important role beauty meant what we choose to be the.

107
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.570
Daniel Pinheiro: Maybe it is the first trigger if we want to talk about triggers.

108
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.220
Daniel Pinheiro: It is the first trigger that we put ourselves into.

109
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.510
Daniel Pinheiro: into sharing some sort of.

110
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.020
Daniel Pinheiro: Saying predisposition.

111
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.660
Daniel Pinheiro: To to.

112
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.270
Daniel Pinheiro: To the utterance or to the drink that we we engage in.

113
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.350
want to add more into that.

114
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.950
Nerina Cocchi: I can, I mean the idea is that so when we get together.

115
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.970
Nerina Cocchi: We are four to six people.

116
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:30.210
Nerina Cocchi: There is Derek their chapter who's not here today, but so this is what we call the band and.

117
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.830
Nerina Cocchi: We have had themes we've had.

118
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:52.710
Nerina Cocchi: we've had there's always something that that leads the improvisation, in a way it can be a female can be the attunement but then, once we get into the apartment we blindfold ourselves, and so we, we only here we don't have the visual stimulus anymore.

119
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.280
Nerina Cocchi: And pretty early on, we.

120
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.040
Nerina Cocchi: We decided to introduce the idea of triggers so if.

121
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:17.580
Nerina Cocchi: We each for ourselves, we decide if this happens, then I do this so an example, it could be, if I hear a high pitch sound I will lift my arms.

122
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:43.560
Nerina Cocchi: Or if I hear something that to me sounds like a word I will produce a growl i'm just giving examples Just to give you ideas and we've created this with the idea that to have these will always bring us back into a place where we can't just do what we want, but we will.

123
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:50.850
Nerina Cocchi: It will give us material to improvise be in relation with the others, and also.

124
00:15:51.750 --> 00:16:02.010
Nerina Cocchi: go into places that are uncomfortable to us, so the idea of trying to push ourselves a little beyond what feels comfortable or what fields within our chords.

125
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:13.110
Nerina Cocchi: And one important discovery that we made with the triggers was the aid of introducing also bodily triggers so not just local ones, but also physical one, so how.

126
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:22.680
Nerina Cocchi: What is the relationship between listening and the body, and how does moving, so it could be that you get up at a certain point or.

127
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:38.820
Nerina Cocchi: That you turn around that you do something with your hand or to cover your face whatever it is what that physical movement also brings you to do in relation with the others, and how it leaves you with the others, but also in connection with your body.

128
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:45.720
Nerina Cocchi: Because listening is a physical action, and so the importance of staying connected connected to the body.

129
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.520
Nerina Cocchi: is rather important.

130
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:58.680
Nerina Cocchi: So that's for triggers I don't know if anybody wants to add a little bit about that or what triggers hadn't brought.

131
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:15.180
annie: Maybe maybe I was thinking that triggers for me and the movements or the actions that go with it, for me, they are functioning as kind of whoo rules.

132
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:36.510
annie: And those rules they helped me to liberate things because I am convinced that, having a few minor rules makes open opening up for all kinds of other things that are outside of those rules so that's one thing, but aside.

133
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.300
annie: I don't like so rules also makes me.

134
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:52.890
annie: And so, these triggers these rules that we have inside utterance makes for a situation.

135
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.380
annie: That, for me, is.

136
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.160
annie: Really, creative and makes me.

137
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:07.950
annie: Every time we do this very happy because I can go somewhere in my life or in my body or in.

138
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.580
annie: Where I never go on normal days and in normal relationships with people.

139
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:24.780
annie: So that's that's for me how they why I liked him so much and why they are important and and the blindfold.

140
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:31.470
annie: is important also because, if I look at you now.

141
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:43.770
annie: i'm aware of something that I, and it brings me in a social situation, and so that social situation really triggers.

142
00:18:44.580 --> 00:19:00.870
annie: habits of being polite or doing certain things and not other things by blindfolding I take it all away and i'm just there with the sound they give me and my own environment and my own body and the machines in between.

143
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.700
that's yeah.

144
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:19.050
constan?a: I guess I can just add something, because we seem to be establishing the paradoxes of mutterings so it's like we have.

145
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:41.730
constan?a: me navigate everywhere between you know freedom and chaos or freedom and constraints let's say freedom and constraints and we also navigate everywhere in between courtesy and chaos and and and both are necessary.

146
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:43.200
constan?a: and

147
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.850
constan?a: The balances between them are very.

148
00:19:48.870 --> 00:20:03.870
constan?a: I think are constantly ethne each iteration and sometimes Indeed, we are very courteous and we open up spaces and we really it's like we're we're eager to.

149
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:14.220
constan?a: to welcome something more than to put forth something and yesterday for, for instance, I think we were all very.

150
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:35.820
constan?a: All of us were proposing we're at some points even too many propositions and we I think what we never really know what's going to be what's going to sound best or what's going to satisfy us more um.

151
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.730
constan?a: So I think there's there's this this paradoxical nature to it.

152
00:20:47.730 --> 00:21:09.420
constan?a: which also involves the fact that, yes, we are aware that we're performing but we don't want to be obliged to deliver a proper performance or a satisfying performance, even so, again, yet another level of paradox we're doing this publicly.

153
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.400
constan?a: And we're not abstaining from.

154
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:16.650
constan?a: from being a flop.

155
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:28.920
constan?a: it's it's a possibility, it needs to be a possibility and and so yeah I think the three levels of paradox are are sufficient for now.

156
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.660
Curt Cloninger: I think that a paradoxically.

157
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:47.460
Curt Cloninger: In in the beginning, before we knew each other as well in this context and trusted each other as well in this context, I think we generally were more courteous.

158
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.530
Curt Cloninger: And I think.

159
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:58.020
Curt Cloninger: The more we trust each other, the more we really are able to risk discourtesy.

160
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.440
Curt Cloninger: which, paradoxically, may be.

161
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:12.090
Curt Cloninger: Because the point is not to be courteous or discourteous or pretty or ugly but to see where it leads, so I think we're all stewarding where this thing leads.

162
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:22.320
Curt Cloninger: Beyond where each of us any individual one of us wants it to go so to me that's why it keeps working just because we keep caring about.

163
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:43.560
Curt Cloninger: What is going to emerge I think we're we're all curious to see what the what the how the sun becomes more than the parts because individually, I would not be doing this, if if I had this this my art practice I wouldn't be on performance number eight.

164
00:22:45.120 --> 00:23:00.300
Curt Cloninger: I mean, I have to blindfold myself and repeat the same phrase for hours on end to get anywhere new as a single performer, but when you have a group of people there's so much variability in that.

165
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:07.050
Curt Cloninger: And maybe that's because language is not a monologue.

166
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:14.310
Curt Cloninger: So to to learn something new about language you need a Community or you're talking to yourself.

167
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.750
Daniel Pinheiro: yeah, I think, adding.

168
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.850
Daniel Pinheiro: I always feel that.

169
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.300
Daniel Pinheiro: And I think it's important to mention that.

170
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.980
Daniel Pinheiro: That it is happening in a very specific context with.

171
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:33.210
Daniel Pinheiro: Through.

172
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.320
Daniel Pinheiro: A video conferencing platform and and God.

173
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:55.110
Daniel Pinheiro: And how do you negotiate the things that you would negotiate normally on a conversation or on or some sort of verbal communication and and this Secondly, when it started when we started doing this.

174
00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:12.990
Daniel Pinheiro: Because coming from different backgrounds and different experiences I think it's also a way of exploring what this space allows us to do, and that articulation between humans, and I mean within the group that we are.

175
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:21.810
Daniel Pinheiro: How like how, how do we deal with the constraints that are already imposed by the medium itself.

176
00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:34.620
Daniel Pinheiro: And and or not doing them but integrate to integrate that there were moments, where we were we we we spoke about.

177
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:48.000
Daniel Pinheiro: What if we try to end this is mine putting putting it up for discussion and there were moments, where we thought, maybe we should get better microphones better maybe we should have like a reliable.

178
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.440
Daniel Pinheiro: sound system where we can hear properly each other and.

179
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.110
Daniel Pinheiro: Somehow better to do the communication better.

180
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:14.370
Daniel Pinheiro: But so far we haven't done that, and and so far that the fragility of the environment and all the glitches and the transformations it makes.

181
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:21.270
Daniel Pinheiro: like the ones it's happening that are happening now in the closed caption thing.

182
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:38.520
Daniel Pinheiro: How do you do with that how to how do we do it remains the question for me, and I think each each experience i'm i'm aware of it, because it's also part of my artistic practice and and try to understand what does it mean.

183
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:52.110
Daniel Pinheiro: Also i'm bringing it up for the context of this conference that we're in, and I was reading like the post pandemic and discharges before and like, how do we continue.

184
00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:01.830
Daniel Pinheiro: didn't start it, because this was the only way to die before that I guess that's also important to say.

185
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:13.110
Nerina Cocchi: it's fine man, because since we've been speaking i've been thinking about the question of why I do this.

186
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:28.110
Nerina Cocchi: And I work with words like that's my medium I write and I work with words and why go in a space where there are no words anymore, and were.

187
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:39.450
Nerina Cocchi: In theory, words are not allowed in theory, because, in practice, sometimes there and sometimes also you make out words in something that isn't words by.

188
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.470
Nerina Cocchi: Our brain does put together things that.

189
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.910
Nerina Cocchi: Are or aren't there our brains new things for us and our bodies do too, so how.

190
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.240
Nerina Cocchi: How, how do you play with that and I don't really have.

191
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.800
Nerina Cocchi: A definite answer if not that I would like to add.

192
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:19.170
Nerina Cocchi: A paradox to what consensus said so consensus spoke about freedom and constraint and courtesy and chaos and for me it's maybe we can put it diagonally but it's a idea of the individual and the self.

193
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.360
Nerina Cocchi: In other words.

194
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:23.970
Nerina Cocchi: To.

195
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.520
Nerina Cocchi: How, how do we use language to communicate and be with others.

196
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:44.370
Nerina Cocchi: Even in a place of not understanding, so what how we were is the importance not understanding being with one another and.

197
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.980
Nerina Cocchi: Being like not talking to one another but being.

198
00:27:51.420 --> 00:28:00.240
Nerina Cocchi: And I think that's what we've been feeling our way through, and the tools that we have, so the achievements that triggers.

199
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:14.040
Nerina Cocchi: The blindfold I really tools to try to to hone a sensitivity and to hone a presence somehow So how do we use the tools that are at our disposal.

200
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:24.870
Nerina Cocchi: To go towards something that makes sense to us, and I think this is even more important in the context in which we find ourselves because we have.

201
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:34.530
Nerina Cocchi: it's not that we have new tools, as the world is different, the question for me remains, why do I want to work long work on and what tools do that do I have.

202
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:50.010
Nerina Cocchi: Or can I use to go deeper into the direction, and I think this is an example of something where by defining certain rules, you can go deeper into things and stretch and see and.

203
00:28:51.420 --> 00:29:09.720
Nerina Cocchi: and see what what comes of it, and he building that material, and I know that in one of our early offerings I spoke about building and I use the word building, how do we build the the offerings and I know that and he looked at me like What do you mean by building.

204
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.360
Nerina Cocchi: i'm not building anything.

205
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:26.370
Nerina Cocchi: And so that opens up the conversation how each of us actually imagines the space in which we work, and it is quite different, we all have very different.

206
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:43.320
Nerina Cocchi: triggers we all have different basis will have different things that push us and through which we articulate ourselves and yet we're all in a common space, and I think that's very important.

207
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.450
Nerina Cocchi: that's a very important thing to bring up and actually to recognize that even.

208
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:54.000
Nerina Cocchi: The fact that we're here is more important than our differences, you know, in a way.

209
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.350
So.

210
00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:10.530
Curt Cloninger: It makes me think about I hate to bring up Claude Shannon i'm not a fan of Claude Shannon but, but just the idea of overcoming the myth of a pure signal.

211
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:28.320
Curt Cloninger: You know that some information theory idea that there's not a pure signal and the signal to noise ratio is what gives the signal it's signal nervous and I think that you know, to get into the ethics of it, perhaps you know it's it's.

212
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:39.330
Curt Cloninger: To to imagine that there is a way people could communicate without an effective glitches and interruptions even in a coffee house across the table from a person.

213
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:52.770
Curt Cloninger: that never happens there's some song playing that reminds you of the 80s and then you're not you stop paying attention and then or you're wearing a mask and you can't see what the person saying or so that's all part of.

214
00:30:54.390 --> 00:31:04.710
Curt Cloninger: You know there's the most pure communication anyone could have be still full of all these effective eruptions is rather than trying to bracket that.

215
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:16.170
Curt Cloninger: or even sort of quarterly sort of cheesy the foreground that and say oh look at all these glitches look at the glitches we made but to say there are going to be enough glitches.

216
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:30.750
Curt Cloninger: Even if you try to keep it pure the glitches will come and and to say you know, this is, this is not an abnormal thing, this is the world even yes so digital so what.

217
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:52.710
Curt Cloninger: This is the way human communication Oh, is this it's just that the the texture of the bodily effect is different, but not impure or on human it's it's in the real world it's all part of real.

218
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.960
Curt Cloninger: it's not virtual.

219
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.250
Curt Cloninger: So it's a real communication that we're doing but in.

220
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.770
Curt Cloninger: In this particular context.

221
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.640
annie: Something that you'll be not touched and you touch again on it somehow is.

222
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.610
annie: I think I know where my motivation comes from my motivation comes from.

223
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:34.500
annie: not speaking the language of the most people around me it comes of being in strange environments where people don't understand me or somehow we act as if i'm a bit stupid because I don't pronounce the word try rightly.

224
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:47.160
annie: that's all very frustrating and it's makes things very unequal if you are in a group of people, the one who speaks the best gets the most attention.

225
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:56.100
annie: So people who come from another country and don't speak as well, their place is already from the start somewhere.

226
00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:18.450
annie: On the bottom of the ladder, if you have to talk like that, and that that makes my relation to language somehow difficult and make me very happy to go to an environment where we work with all kinds of other things and not with meaning of with the meaning of the words.

227
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.800
annie: So somehow for me this is political it's a political project also.

228
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:36.450
annie: To be doing and it's called two words a supra semiotic telepresence communication so mark, I thought, what is.

229
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:40.350
Daniel Pinheiro: Not.

230
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.320
annie: possible, but at the same time and that's.

231
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:50.220
annie: Also paradox, I want to believe in it so and we are doing it in a certain way.

232
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.150
So yeah.

233
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.740
constan?a: yeah I think i'd like to add something sorry.

234
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.780
No go ahead, good.

235
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.030
constan?a: um.

236
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:14.520
constan?a: I don't think we've ever really discussed, you know the the like the effects on each of us, and I would have to say that.

237
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.340
constan?a: No matter how distinct our meetings have been.

238
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.170
constan?a: I end up more energized and calmer than I was before.

239
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.660
constan?a: And this is.

240
00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.210
constan?a: There is no.

241
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:39.090
constan?a: Objective I mean quantifiable reason for this.

242
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.140
constan?a: For me, at least, because.

243
00:34:43.230 --> 00:35:01.170
constan?a: I mean, these are public instances of meeting so there's a stressful ness of kindle being seen, but at the same time, and this is again personal there's the there's the release from language in what it means.

244
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.230
constan?a: In its burden of correction and surveillance.

245
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:19.260
constan?a: I, I can see how, for me, this would be political, in a sense, and for me it would be political in another sense, which is that I.

246
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.980
constan?a: I want for language to remain.

247
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.010
constan?a: With no taboos or maintaining its taboos and for sound to do as well.

248
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:39.630
constan?a: And so it's you know I find myself as someone who also works with words and text and who.

249
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.370
constan?a: deals with people who are very.

250
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.160
constan?a: skilled speakers very learned speakers.

251
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.080
constan?a: My daily activities are filled with this sort of.

252
00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:01.260
constan?a: Underlying surveillance and need to not be you know.

253
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.110
constan?a: incorrect.

254
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.280
constan?a: And it's it's an unlivable situation, I have to say.

255
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.280
constan?a: So i'm.

256
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:27.030
constan?a: On rings is somehow free and also somehow ascetic like in it nears if it comes near some sort of meditative practice where I.

257
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.820
constan?a: Where I purge maybe.

258
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.330
constan?a: something's and let go of.

259
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.690
constan?a: A level of.

260
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.530
constan?a: Awareness of myself as.

261
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:55.770
constan?a: Another, which is always there and so that's very that's very the ends up being very calming and very energizing so you know all of the richness of.

262
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:22.920
constan?a: The constraints and the even the morals of language, I feel I am free from, and in that sense, I am very happy and other things, and things are easier and and, if indeed someone shreds on my toe or steps over my sound there are free to do so, and I can strike back, and we can you know.

263
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.530
constan?a: This can be the star wars of.

264
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:42.960
constan?a: ugly sounds and that's why it's so different from every you know from most of my living experience and so it's it's yeah I don't know how how best to explain this but uh.

265
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.840
constan?a: But really the release of.

266
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.390
constan?a: The Panopticon that I have in my head as a speaker.

267
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.690
constan?a: is very important.

268
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.090
Can you.

269
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:09.210
Daniel Pinheiro: Please, I was, I was just going to add when it comes in, like continuation of what you were saying, because yesterday.

270
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.270
Daniel Pinheiro: We created a monster.

271
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.940
Curt Cloninger: A bad set of baby dinosaur.

272
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:15.690
baby.

273
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.790
annie: No baby.

274
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.610
Curt Cloninger: Oh baby monster okay baby monster.

275
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.020
Curt Cloninger: But it was a baby monster.

276
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:37.230
Daniel Pinheiro: And, yesterday we didn't do it, but there were moments, where we tried other visual configurations for for a drink one of them was using like the overlay of all of our video feed and indeed look like a weird.

277
00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:38.700
monster.

278
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.380
Daniel Pinheiro: Trying to communicate something.

279
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:55.170
Daniel Pinheiro: And I think it's interesting with constraints that brings this this experience which can free us from from any any.

280
00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:05.670
Daniel Pinheiro: Any say any in positions that you put yourself in in perhaps other other conditions and sometimes when i'm doing.

281
00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:16.080
Daniel Pinheiro: An encounter of entering they always have this weird image of how does it work from the outside, here in my room that when i'm doing it.

282
00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:26.400
Daniel Pinheiro: And what I and then I picture, all of us alone in different places with our eyes, we blindfolded and we're just like this.

283
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:38.760
Daniel Pinheiro: individually we're all I picture as as as incomplete parts of this monster that it's happening, which is an energetic which I can call her feel like an energetic monster.

284
00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:51.780
Daniel Pinheiro: and keep using the word master because that's also how I feel about it, sometimes, and I think it comes tied with the ugliness that we allow ourselves.

285
00:39:52.680 --> 00:40:06.990
Daniel Pinheiro: Here so there's something interesting to be said in this this this incomplete version of ourselves in our physical instances of each one when we come together here to do this.

286
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.230
and

287
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:29.850
Daniel Pinheiro: I think, in this sense of what what is communication, I think I feel it's precisely that it's it's like a sum of all these incomplete bits and parts that we're all trying to make sense of as as as human being.

288
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:31.890
Daniel Pinheiro: yeah.

289
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:33.780
Daniel Pinheiro: I would say.

290
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.600
Daniel Pinheiro: Like the.

291
00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.350
Few I want to say something.

292
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:52.770
for that.

293
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.380
annie: yeah it's open for if you if you have you, you can put it.

294
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:06.540
annie: out, but you can also just unmute yourself and ask questions No problem.

295
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.280
Nerina Cocchi: Sharing easier now when us together.

296
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:19.530
annie: I think we touched on the most and most points we wanted to touch on is something we forgot to talk about.

297
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.610
let's think of it.

298
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.300
Nerina Cocchi: For me, the thing that, from what concerns has said about.

299
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.820
Nerina Cocchi: Language I mean, I also have the same experiences me of being.

300
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:45.180
Nerina Cocchi: A feeling inadequate in all languages in the sense that I always feel i'm not pull that i'm always missing words that i'm.

301
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:55.350
Nerina Cocchi: That I don't have a good grasp of language, whatever language that is.

302
00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.490
Nerina Cocchi: And what.

303
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.510
Nerina Cocchi: I know that what uttering has contributed me.

304
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.090
Nerina Cocchi: With is the idea of.

305
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:23.490
Nerina Cocchi: How, how do you stay in that sense sensitive spot where you can just be here and listen and speak at the same time, and whether it is right doesn't really matter as long as it's.

306
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:42.360
Nerina Cocchi: Just as you say, in French like it's it feels it feels right, and so I think that's part of what is so touching and also for me it's not only about the offerings per se it's also about the relationship that leaves us together like.

307
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:57.690
Nerina Cocchi: The fact that I, like all of the five of you, makes me want to come back if I didn't like you, as people I wouldn't want to come back and so I think that's.

308
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:11.280
Nerina Cocchi: Language as a way to leave people together and to have conversations and I really think this is what's important and what sometimes we forget is that language is a tool.

309
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:19.590
Nerina Cocchi: To talk and yes it's messy yes we don't understand each other, of course, because each of us has their own language, in a way, but.

310
00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:31.800
Nerina Cocchi: How do we, how do we get to that sensitive right spot in a way that's and this experience has been helping me that I don't know.

311
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:43.320
Curt Cloninger: I like what you're saying that language is just a tool to to connect I mean this is related to my.

312
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.390
Curt Cloninger: Personal explorations theologically.

313
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:54.060
Curt Cloninger: The goal of having a relationship with God is not to come to some sort of.

314
00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:00.060
Curt Cloninger: Knowledge of facts it's, not even to come to a.

315
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.090
Curt Cloninger: Communication where.

316
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.700
Curt Cloninger: meaning is conveyed.

317
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:07.560
Curt Cloninger: it's to.

318
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.020
Curt Cloninger: be known and to know.

319
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.320
Curt Cloninger: Beyond language.

320
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:24.720
Curt Cloninger: And maybe that's true with every human and every human other human with my wife I don't want to know facts about her or even you know I mean I need if she wants me to.

321
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:32.550
Curt Cloninger: take out the garbage I need to know literally that's what she's conveying to me, but that the goal of humans.

322
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:44.580
Curt Cloninger: Being intimate with each other is it's not that you understand or know something there's there's a there's a game there's an end game beyond that this is just some means.

323
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:54.360
Curt Cloninger: So I think, and it is, it is a you know, a spiritual practice to speak in tongues where you don't understand what you're saying, and you know.

324
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.580
Curt Cloninger: there's the practice of APA faces where.

325
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:13.200
Curt Cloninger: You use words to undo words so that you don't over determine God or rely so much on words any God worth worshiping is is gonna have to be beyond words or you got the wrong person.

326
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:23.340
annie: If you want to i'm very happy with that, but I was thinking of someone else something else.

327
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:37.650
annie: We didn't touch on that yet is is, why is it a performance that we are doing, why do we need the ID of an audience and because somehow that's important.

328
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:55.410
annie: In what we do and I think, for me, that is, because if there is an audience for what you do you have a shared collaboration towards something else and it's something that unites us and.

329
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.390
He said understandable what I say or not.

330
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.360
yeah I think.

331
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.720
Daniel Pinheiro: At least from yesterday from the few reactions that I could see Brittany.

332
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:18.780
Daniel Pinheiro: It made me think about that from from the performance, we did yesterday, there were a few reactions and they all mentioned, or they kind of mentioned.

333
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.810
Daniel Pinheiro: The power of presence that we were able to deliver.

334
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:42.210
Daniel Pinheiro: With the performance I don't know like i'm not backwards, but it had something to do with this and and I guess that's when when you say and it gives it opens up about for a shared.

335
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:43.710
Nerina Cocchi: it's.

336
00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:49.530
Daniel Pinheiro: Not just between us towards something else, which is also being communicated to someone else.

337
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:56.970
Daniel Pinheiro: And what what, meaning that the audience makes it that I think it's another layer that.

338
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:57.390
Nerina Cocchi: process.

339
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.910
Daniel Pinheiro: we're trying to go beyond this idea of an understandable.

340
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:14.640
Daniel Pinheiro: Language order or like we say like going above rationality, but leaving the door open for interpretation that might come through from the other end.

341
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.100
of whoever is watching.

342
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.460
Daniel Pinheiro: or doing it with us because we've had.

343
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.150
annie: Governments when.

344
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.150
Daniel Pinheiro: you're done performance workshops.

345
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.690
With people that join from one or two times.

346
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.760
Daniel Pinheiro: And I see that also is not a performance per se but we're opening up to other people and there's this exchange of.

347
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.360
Daniel Pinheiro: Beyond this group of people that.

348
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.120
Daniel Pinheiro: We keep on practicing this.

349
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.140
constan?a: We add something we're going to say something.

350
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:51.270
Nerina Cocchi: Nice okay go for it.

351
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:53.190
Nerina Cocchi: keep it short.

352
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.450
constan?a: I think this is yet another paradox.

353
00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.970
constan?a: Is that we.

354
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.070
constan?a: intimate without having been friends.

355
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:07.710
Curt Cloninger: you're not my friend.

356
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.300
constan?a: I mean.

357
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:20.490
constan?a: i've not been with you i've never even touched you we don't smell each other, I am you know i'm a touchy feely 3D person.

358
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:26.310
constan?a: i'm demanding of that of my friends, then he knows.

359
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:41.160
constan?a: And he I think the having an audience in this moment of in history when having a conversation is almost impossible.

360
00:48:42.420 --> 00:49:01.620
constan?a: You know, because everything is so polarized or trial terrorized or just ossified in you know I I know this, I think this, and this is what I stand for and who you're doing something outside of that and.

361
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.780
constan?a: I think.

362
00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:16.530
constan?a: I think we've reasons to be hopeful, you know I didn't I didn't expect to be saying this about other things, but what happens to us is evidence of that.

363
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.480
constan?a: What happened in the workshops as evidence of that.

364
00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.580
constan?a: and

365
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:28.770
constan?a: yeah i'm going to quit because i'm going to start crying so.

366
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.240
constan?a: you've never seen this is you're not my friend now.

367
00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.740
Nerina Cocchi: The thing I wanted to say is that.

368
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:51.180
Nerina Cocchi: i'm always wondering why anybody would want to see a mattress like i'm i'm i'm puzzled by it.

369
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:57.000
Nerina Cocchi: But people come and watch this and people want to be part of it and.

370
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:13.710
Nerina Cocchi: Then i'm like Okay, I cannot decide whether this works or not like intimately with my partner we call attorneys Hollings because, like he he walks into the apartment and i'm they're making the weirdest sounds with the cats looking at me like I mean saying.

371
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.050
Nerina Cocchi: And this is to answer part of danny's question or what happens like.

372
00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:30.540
Nerina Cocchi: But you know were there, and we are handling all together to the moon somehow in our own digital way I don't know no but it's it's it's.

373
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:41.430
Nerina Cocchi: I like the yet another paradox that adds that gets added to this sorry that we sort of have so yeah.

374
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.280
Daniel Pinheiro: yeah literally yesterday howling into.

375
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:48.900
This full moon it's happening.

376
00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:54.690
Nerina Cocchi: yeah.

377
00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.880
annie: Now we come to the farmer.

378
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.090
Nerina Cocchi: Just something more to.

379
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:07.590
annie: Thank you for having been with us.

380
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:07.890
All.

381
00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.880
annie: So see you all on the front of that.

382
00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.280
Yes.
