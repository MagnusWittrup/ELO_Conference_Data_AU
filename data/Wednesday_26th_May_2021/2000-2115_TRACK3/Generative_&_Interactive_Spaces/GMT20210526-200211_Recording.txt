00:16:58	Leah Henrickson:	Building anticipation?
00:17:14	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Tech issues, the student assisstants needed a password do the thing...
00:17:30	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Just go ahead, Anastasia, sorry for the confusion
00:17:37	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	we could do it acapella
00:17:54	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	We'll do that at the end of the session! :-)
00:26:47	Katie Schaag:	Fascinating work, Zach!
00:27:23	Anastasia Salter:	Feel free to post questions in the chat as we go, and we'll start the conversation after all four presentations!
00:34:20	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	this is really cool
00:34:38	Davin Heckman:	So cool!
00:34:50	Roberta Iadevaia:	beautifull
00:34:52	Leah Henrickson:	WHERE WERE THESE TWO PAPERS FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN I NEEDED THEM?!
00:35:00	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Yes, this is great. I want to see examples of poetry generated with this method!
00:36:44	Stephanie Strickland:	me too!
00:36:54	James Ryan:	:)
00:37:05	Scott Rettberg:	Are you getting good food!
00:37:17	Scott Rettberg:	That is the question
00:37:25	Scott Rettberg:	and does it rhyme
00:37:45	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	It was great last year, even though it was BYO everything
00:38:01	Katie Schaag:	Fluxus Food!!
00:38:25	Roberta Iadevaia:	fluxood
00:38:32	Katie Schaag:	Haha love it ^
00:41:27	Scott Rettberg:	Gastropoetics is better than Taco Bell.
00:41:41	Lai-Tze Fan:	Pretty sure Taco Bell rotates the same 12 ingredients—which also means anything can be made vegetarian. Algorithm, indeed!
00:41:48	Scott Rettberg:	Except for the cocktails
00:41:52	Katie Schaag:	hence why the tacohell bot is perfect
00:42:05	Scott Rettberg:	Those were pretty bad
00:42:07	Leah Henrickson:	For a second, I thought Scott meant that Taco Bell had cocktails.
00:42:23	Katie Schaag:	https://twitter.com/TacoHellMenu
00:43:21	Scott Rettberg:	https://gastropoetics.menu/quarantine-quatrains/000.MAINS.html
00:43:26	Katie Schaag:	Love this intervention, Davin!
00:43:29	Scott Rettberg:	roll your own
00:43:40	Andrew Klobucar:	Make your own sandwich?
00:44:27	Davin Heckman:	Everything’s a sandwich.
00:47:31	Leah Henrickson:	Lyr, it seems like D. Fox Harrell's book Phantasmal Media would nicely complement the work you've done here - not sure if you've read it, but I noticed it wasn't referenced in your paper, so just thought I'd pop the recommendation here.
00:48:44	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	+1
00:49:10	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	Also, David Parisi's work on haptic semiotics
00:50:27	Lyr Colin:	Thank you for the references!
00:50:41	Katie Schaag:	Leah yes, love D. Fox Harrell’s work
00:50:50	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	I know I ran through a bunch of examples, so here are my slides in case you want to look at them: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11-__e_K2FwFc90lpa7-TlzgGXmwZIjjQw303QY_HhAI/edit?usp=sharing
00:51:00	Katie Schaag:	Lyr, love your concept of hugging pixels :)
00:51:10	Katie Schaag:	Thanks Zach, fascinating examples!
00:57:55	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	The possibility of computer-generated books that were not generated by a computer (which I agree with and am personally fascinated with, basically that's what my research project is about) begs the question of whether there can be books that were generated by a computer that is not included in the category of computer-generated books. Perhaps? Thoughts? Where are the boundaries -- do we (still?) need boundaries?
01:00:47	Leah Henrickson:	Super quick note about marketing Artificial Versifying - Even though it's called a 'schoolboy's recreation', it's not likely that many school children (or other everyday folks, for that matter) would have had any access to this book. The cost of books/paper was just way too high. More info about the reception of this work would be an amazing future research project!
01:02:09	Andrew Klobucar:	Malthe - thinking about it from a position based in aesthetic theory, once computer-generated books become the standard method, as it is, in a way, the book as print document might become increasingly aesthetically significant…
01:02:38	James Ryan:	@Leah One remarkable aspect of the A.V. system is that its procedure was reprinted in various periodicals for the next 200 years! It likely appeared in newspapers and other widely disseminated texts, as well. It was a “viral text”, for sure!
01:03:38	Leah Henrickson:	@James Ohhhhh, love that! Would love to know more.
01:03:51	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Thanks, Zach!I would follow up with some spoken general agreement, but Søren is next to me asking a question in another panel.
01:04:06	James Ryan:	@Leah we tough on it in the paper, though I’d love to explore further!
01:04:33	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	But it's in those unstable spaces between definitions that the magic happens
01:04:36	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	@James have you found it in the Viral Texts database (https://viraltexts.org/)?
01:04:55	Leah Henrickson:	@James Have only managed to skim the paper so far, but will give it a thorough read next week, once marking's done. Looking forward to it. Expect questions.
01:05:23	James Ryan:	@Zach I love that project, but hadn’t thought to look there—great idea!
01:05:55	James Ryan:	@Leah looking forward to them!
01:07:27	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	@Andrew, yes definitely, I guess that's what's implied in the notion of post-digital, but instead of bouncing between binaries of computer-generated and human-written, perhaps we need to embrace and thrive in the middle.
01:08:15	James Ryan:	@Malthe Carole Spearin McCauley, whom Zach mentioned in his talk, articulated a poetics in that liminal space as early as the 1970s!
01:08:48	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	@James, sounds awesome, will check it out, thanks!
01:10:10	James Ryan:	I believe this is the right PDF:
01:10:32	Andrew Klobucar:	Those examples make Dogecoin sound reasonable
01:11:08	Katie Schaag:	Returns it to the artist’s book tradition — books as objects are exhibited in museums and collected in archives
01:12:05	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	@James, thanks for the pdf
01:12:14	James Ryan:	My pleasure
01:13:45	Davin Heckman:	Lyr: There is an artist, Miguel Elizalde, who records infrasound and builds installations to replay them.
01:13:47	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	Archive.org also has all of McCauley's computer-assisted (and adjacent) works like this overview of the field https://archive.org/details/computerscreativ00mcca
01:15:22	Davin Heckman:	Also, Hayles’ Unthought might be a useful read, if you haven’t already.
01:17:01	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Thanks, both. Hayles is a classic, obviously :-)
01:19:25	Scott Rettberg:	http://muep.mau.se/handle/2043/12547 Talan’s dissertation Digital rhetoric and poetics : signifying strategies in electronic literature
01:21:39	James Ryan:	On the note of reader response, Leah’s recent book! https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/reading-computergenerated-texts/402FD0C808FE7E92E8BC9E88EBE23CA6
01:21:51	Andrew Klobucar:	I like the collaborative element in Rettberg’s and Talan’s project. Like Fluxus, it brought people together…
01:21:52	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	+1
01:24:44	Leah Henrickson:	The Plague, The Great Fire of London....
01:24:48	Leah Henrickson:	Things were not good, Zach. Not good.
01:25:08	Stephanie Strickland:	exactly!
01:27:17	Lyr Colin:	It also seems like he's trying to impart wisdom, especially with the intended public of children? It really reminded me of what my parents' generation had in elementary school with the "daily moral statement" and so on
01:27:18	Leah Henrickson:	If I remember correctly, the Eureka poetry generation machine (~1830s) followed some similar poetic aesthetics?
01:27:35	James Ryan:	Yep, that’s right!
01:29:43	Davin Heckman:	I love these early examples. I’d like to think about folk traditions of wordplay that might have existed alongside these early examples.
01:29:49	James Ryan:	Thanks, Anastasia!
01:29:53	Melinda White (she/her):	Thank you!
01:29:56	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	Thank you all, a fascinating panel!
01:29:57	Davin Heckman:	Thank you!
01:29:58	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	It was the wonderful panel. I was impressed how the papers entered in dialogue with each other! Thank you all!
01:30:00	Kedrick James:	Thanks for the great session to all
01:30:03	Roberta Iadevaia:	thank you!
01:30:05	Andrew Klobucar:	Thanks for the panel! Very great work
01:30:08	Katie Schaag:	Thanks y’all! Fascinating conversations!
01:30:14	Kenton Taylor Howard:	Thanks everyone!
