1
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.370
Anastasia Salter: Alright nevermind we'll dispense with a Jingle.

2
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.700
Anastasia Salter: seems a shame not to start this one on retro gaming aesthetics, but we will roll out.

3
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.480
Anastasia Salter: So thank you for joining us, and particularly for still being with us this way here in near the end of the incredible.

4
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:53.130
Anastasia Salter: and lengthy conference day then organizing team has put together for us so we're going to go through just short presentations in the order list in the program so first up is exactly island with the generated word.

5
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.150
Zach Whalen (He|Him): All right, Hello everyone.

6
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.990
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'm going to share my screen and get started, so this would be a short.

7
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.240
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Presentation based on much longer paper so i'm going to move kind of quickly through some things and not really have much time to get into any of the examples, but.

8
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.550
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'm hoping that you may recognize some of these examples, and of course we can talk about some of these in the discussion as we go into it.

9
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.130
Zach Whalen (He|Him): First of all, the title has changed slightly I switched out the word generic for metaphoric and you'll see why I hope is again to it but.

10
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.820
Zach Whalen (He|Him): My idea was think I was just I was attracted to the alliteration and also, I think it makes it better juxtaposition with Meta nemec and it also more precisely identifies what I actually want to talk about.

11
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.610
Zach Whalen (He|Him): In general, what I want to talk about in this is a computer generated books, so this is a broad category of things and i'm attempting to.

12
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.450
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Narrow it slightly by casting a pretty wide net and then sort of chopping that net into three still pretty large pieces, I suppose.

13
00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.480
Zach Whalen (He|Him): But just broadly i'm thinking about books that are generated in some way by a computer i'm going to not going to talk about generation or methods or.

14
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.740
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Things like that, because those are topics well covered elsewhere and other presentations at this conference and just in general, but of course we can talk about those if that's.

15
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.110
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Something that you're interested in i'm also going to be talking about including in the spring, net that i'm casting.

16
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:21.990
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Many, many different genres and purposes and motivations for creating a computer generated book so that includes you know that all of these different genres.

17
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:39.600
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Here and more also when I think about computer generated books, I am thinking of specifically probably several your printed like physical books but also, I would include in that pdfs as well hoops me back.

18
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.360
Zach Whalen (He|Him): So sorry I had an extra button there so and i'm thinking pdfs as book like enough or.

19
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.960
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'm kind of thinking through what Lisa Lisa Gilman calls.

20
00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:01.560
Zach Whalen (He|Him): near prints where she says that pdfs or individually bounded and distinct and so in a lot of ways they carry a lot of the properties or the rhetorics of print, and so I feel like it's appropriate to include those in these.

21
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.140
Zach Whalen (He|Him): terms of the sources and, like the scope, I guess, of this big broad net that i'm casting there are several important sources or venues, I guess, for.

22
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.840
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Computer generated books to exist, so I am thinking, the largest that certainly comes from nano general national novel generation month but i'm also thinking about.

23
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:30.660
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Certain publishers like counter path which does the using electricity series i'm also thinking about artistic print on demand, which is another interesting kind of adjacent category of digital they re work.

24
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.260
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'm also thinking of listed here is the first book ever written by a computer with a picture of policemen spear just have constructed.

25
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:47.220
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And I don't mean just that book, but I mean books like it and there's almost a sub genre or some type of books that are known or described as the first ever book written by computer there's there's several of those.

26
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.370
Zach Whalen (He|Him): So those are these are just kind of broad categories and i'm thinking through and then these, these are the three.

27
00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.020
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I guess genres or maybe heuristics, these are the three differences different strands I suppose that i'm interested in, as I talk about these.

28
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.770
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Meta nemec metaphors and operation list, and I just want to go through and look at each of these with some examples of each and then.

29
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.570
Zach Whalen (He|Him): that's pretty much it so magnetic books, these are books, with a literary or artistic appeal that is specifically bookish so I here's.

30
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:26.550
Zach Whalen (He|Him): specifically mean bookish as in the bullishness that just expressing and talks about where these are books, where their material factor, the circumstances their existence or their sculptural qualities or their perpetual elements.

31
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.130
Zach Whalen (He|Him): or even the ways in which their their content, seems to be addressing their production circulation and reception, these are things that.

32
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.780
Zach Whalen (He|Him): are met an image in the sense that it is a book, but it is also making us think about books inviting us to think about those things.

33
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:57.780
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Reading for these is often trivial or relevant So these are almost like book shapes works of art, you might say so, a lot of the print on demand works fit into this category, so things like the black book or volume or dear lulu there's others as well that I would include in this category.

34
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.610
Zach Whalen (He|Him): The cover of the sun also rises which prints out the names of colors in pixels of an image of the cover of the sun also rises.

35
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:17.970
Zach Whalen (He|Him): A simic writing is another example, and this one may be a bit controversial, but I want to also put in a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviants into this category of men and women, because it's very much shaped like a book, but not exactly readable.

36
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.400
Zach Whalen (He|Him): other words that have been generated These are words that you can literally read, but that are shaped like a book in ways that are meant to be evocative and.

37
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:36.270
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Hopefully, are the one that I created I hope this evocative So those are reading books and again their their book like this has to do with their their importance in their meaning.

38
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.210
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Not important books are those with their meanings contingent upon existing literature or genres So these are words a parody satire remix any number of other.

39
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:53.340
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Words you can put into that often the procedure for generating these is trivial, or at least it's easy to figure out or reverse engineer.

40
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.940
Zach Whalen (He|Him): This would include things like the various kinds of travesty generator works Markov chains would fall into this usually.

41
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:12.870
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Reading is the point for these and it's often pretty funny or it's meant to be funny so This includes things like emoji deke which uses emoji to translate the texts of emerging of moby Dick.

42
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.810
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Through the prejudice class which swapped out dialogue from pride and prejudice with dialogue from moby Dick twice intelligence which puts the content of tweets into the dialogue of pride and prejudice.

43
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:30.180
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Other examples moby Dick she he which just adds parents medical like giggles every time the word Dick or sperm appears in.

44
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:39.420
Zach Whalen (He|Him): moby Dick, which I find hilarious 50,000 meals, you could also say that this is a Meta nemec book as well, because you can't exactly read it, but it replaces the text of.

45
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:52.740
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Any book with appropriately sized words transformation, so the word meal and then auto summarize buying just now here's an example, this is from recent nano DEMO this is ready player in which.

46
00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:04.560
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Is a parody of whichever work you run through the through the system, but it also is a parody of ready player one it basically inserts unnecessary pop cultural references into any text so.

47
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.960
Zach Whalen (He|Him): This is from the climactic scene and Frankenstein.

48
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.190
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'll just read a bit here, I would have seized him, but he alluded me and put in the House with Preston.

49
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:19.110
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Preston precipitation in a few moments I saw him and his boat pretty much like Sunday crockett scarab in Miami vice, but not as bad as what shot across the waters with an arrow we swiftness.

50
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.600
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And as soon last a miss the waves, so you can see how it's improving Frankenstein way adding more contemporary references.

51
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:31.170
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And then, finally, an operational his books, these are books, where the meaning emerges from contemplating the computational origins of the work.

52
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:39.600
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And there's basically two subtypes Of these, these are those were the processes are evident where we know what they are, because the source code is shared and that's kind of the interesting parts.

53
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:51.180
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And this is also includes works, where the code is not shared and there's some sense of obfuscation in both of those cases, our interest often lies in the process, we want to know how this was made, and this includes works that.

54
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.690
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Where we don't know exactly how they were made, because they weren't.

55
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:05.430
Zach Whalen (He|Him): The authors weren't forthcoming about the processes so we wonder about the process and we want to know how they made these books, so this includes things like policeman's beard just this once wescott French haven't thing and travel on but carolyn McCauley.

56
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.260
Zach Whalen (He|Him): and also some more recent books were in these cases, we do know many of the processes.

57
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.770
Zach Whalen (He|Him): But there's still a tease and some question about how they works and and why, and so that becomes part of our interest in working on these.

58
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.470
Zach Whalen (He|Him): This is probably the largest category and probably the most familiar category to people in this audience, I would say.

59
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:33.690
Zach Whalen (He|Him): This is just a brief point i'll just this, this will be my final thing here a, this is a work called simple dialogues from the most recent managing mode and it's it's a it takes the.

60
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:42.120
Zach Whalen (He|Him): It takes a simple dialogue, a simple conversation and then breaks down each of the phonetic aspects of each word spoken in that dialogue.

61
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:53.280
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And then translate them into the physiological describing the physiological processes necessary to make the sounds that produced the words in this civil dialogue, and then we get the words so it's this really like intimate almost erotic kind of thing.

62
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.790
Zach Whalen (He|Him): She keeps some space between your tongue on the roof of your mouth with her vocal folds.

63
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:04.440
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Tennessee releases air through her mouth she runs her lips, so that they create a small opening with her tongue and relaxed position at the back or mousy titans her vocal folds releases air through your mouth.

64
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:13.470
Zach Whalen (He|Him): In the traditional nano gen was 50,000 words of pros like this and it's really quite evocative I think and intimate and interesting.

65
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:25.920
Zach Whalen (He|Him): So that's it, these are the three kinds i'm going to fork magnetic operational list I understand they're they're kind of rough I feel like the i'm still not totally satisfied with the terminology and a lot of ways, so I look forward to your.

66
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:33.900
Zach Whalen (He|Him): questions and comments and discussion, but I hope it's a useful entryway into this really large and really interesting field of computer generated books.

67
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.640
Zach Whalen (He|Him): So thank you.

68
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.160
Anastasia Salter: Thanks.

69
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.880
Anastasia Salter: Next up, we have kayden Burke and rickrolling and James Brian with English diversification for the billion.

70
00:10:52.470 --> 00:11:10.710
Henry Koelling: cool I can start i'm i'm Henry alongside kayden and James from the computer science department at carleton college we're pleased to be sharing with you our paper English for supplication for the billion translating the early Latin poetry generator artificial versifying.

71
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.690
So.

72
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:24.000
Henry Koelling: The subject of our research artificial versifying was published in the form of a booklet and 1677 by London based inventor john Peter.

73
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:35.790
Henry Koelling: Within the book, there are six table is comprised of what seemed to be scrambled letters, however, following the system device by Peter tables can be used to produce adequately form that in Dec teletext a minute.

74
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:43.620
Henry Koelling: They didn't Peter second edition of the clip just a year later, it took them over 12 years to produce the system.

75
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:57.450
Henry Koelling: Now, although we cannot know for certain we can speculate that his creative process was influenced by the great player London, which was occurring 12 years before the initial publication, something that we can all relate to.

76
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.560
Henry Koelling: So we can look at the actual tables now.

77
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.680
Kaeden Berg: So we're going to walk through very quickly how these tables are actually work.

78
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:16.320
Kaeden Berg: The idea is each input is six digits that each digit will then correspond to one of these six.

79
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:27.930
Kaeden Berg: tables, the digital is us, with a special process which will show you in a second to basically create a word from scrambled letters in the tables tables themselves are actually word banks.

80
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:39.420
Kaeden Berg: Each corresponding to different types of words that mean the sentence, for example, the first one is normative case nouns which would often be the subject, or could also be accusative case for some of them.

81
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:52.590
Kaeden Berg: So what will happen is you'll take your did your first digit and what you'll do is, you will take it by one and start counting so for inputs five start counting it is six.

82
00:12:53.220 --> 00:13:06.600
Kaeden Berg: And then it'll count up, seven, eight and then the Nice letter you write down to that is your first letter and you restart the count and you can't back up to nine again to get your next letter and you continue this process, all the way up until you hit one of the black boxes.

83
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.480
Kaeden Berg: Each of the nine letter sequences contain a letter for each of the words, the word banks some letters some words and earlier.

84
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:25.080
Kaeden Berg: So, because of that some of the letters and the letter sequences are actually just randomized so not all letters will correspond to works, but you see, we hit the black box and we got the word tour to be that.

85
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:28.710
Kaeden Berg: One second.

86
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.530
Henry Koelling: Well, so as for a translation approach.

87
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.540
Henry Koelling: We aim to translate this in English, of course, there are many.

88
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.150
Henry Koelling: difficulties in doing so.

89
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:51.570
Henry Koelling: Inspired by many works, including the renderings project by Nick mumford and many others, we have to contribute to the growing area of Isla translation.

90
00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:02.370
Henry Koelling: So rather than focusing on translating individual outputs we focused on translating the actual system itself artificial versifying is capable of generating.

91
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:21.600
Henry Koelling: 531,441 unique lines of adequately formed Latin verse from just 54 words in the tables so to to do so, Peter relied on specific characteristics of the Latin language when organizing these six tables.

92
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:28.920
Henry Koelling: And unfortunately characteristics on directly translate into English, and this could be.

93
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:38.070
Henry Koelling: turned this could be coined as the local our algorithmic dissonance concepts defined by kaitlyn.

94
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:47.580
Henry Koelling: So come back this issue, we produce multiple translations of the 54 words that address different aspects of the Latin.

95
00:14:48.090 --> 00:15:05.850
Henry Koelling: First approach we focused on preserving the meeting of the Latin words and paper we refer to this as aggressive meaning preservation and then next we focused on preserving the meter of the Latin for structure and there in our paper we refer to this as the aggressive meter preservation.

96
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:23.730
Henry Koelling: After using both these translations we attempted to construct a magnum opus combining both of these ideas into one final translation, and in doing so, we were forced to make several conduct in session.

97
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.540
Henry Koelling: And among, among others, the problems.

98
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:36.660
Henry Koelling: we've grappled with the most were maintaining the meeting and the meter and also producing grammatical English that preserve the original Latin word order.

99
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:43.170
Henry Koelling: Now we can look at a sample output featuring all of our different translation.

100
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.510
Kaeden Berg: So for the input of 25933 to.

101
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:54.180
Kaeden Berg: The original artificial first fine would give us torpedo Bella skill Castle bunch tempura pro.

102
00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:03.840
Kaeden Berg: It for just translating word by word, which is our aggressive meaning translation, it gives us the ugly wars, I think, create times wicked you can already see the.

103
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:12.600
Kaeden Berg: idea of Gary kind of get with English is trying to give you, but some words are switched around in weird ways and it doesn't exactly makes sense.

104
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:24.150
Kaeden Berg: Are aggressive meaning translation also is not meaning for English comprehension per se if we wanted to get that we would end up switching word order which is really hard to do so we're also hoping to preserve.

105
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:37.350
Kaeden Berg: input correspondence, so if we want to switch the last word with the second to last word, then the input would actually be different to give us the same output we'd have to give it to 59323 instead.

106
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.550
Kaeden Berg: Our aggressive meter translation was attempting some form of.

107
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.240
Kaeden Berg: Taking the Latin original examiner and binding it to English it doesn't work exactly because Latin.

108
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:56.400
Kaeden Berg: Really relies on variable length and in English valid links can change, depending on the context of the word, or where you're from.

109
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:05.430
Kaeden Berg: it's not as hard set as it was in some Latin poetry, so we instead have a couple different methods we use that we described in our paper to kind of buying this.

110
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:15.570
Kaeden Berg: Old meter to English our final compromise focuses both on getting the meaning across and the meter and also English comprehension, this was a more.

111
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:30.150
Kaeden Berg: Experimental one where we do actually switch the tables orders around, and we also change around some of the actual words themselves were somewhere, one of the tables had adjectives and adverbs and we tried to find it just to be adjectives because.

112
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:40.350
Kaeden Berg: The word order between adjective noun and verb adverb end up getting very funky and made the outputs sound incorrect.

113
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.570
Kaeden Berg: So we have to show you our tables, we finally made, which was one of the most important parts to us was.

114
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:58.560
Kaeden Berg: Keeping this original format and seeing if we could generate our own poems based on that and, as you can see, we are able to ours, of course, spaces and a lot more extra randomized letters near the end just because the word.

115
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:08.820
Kaeden Berg: Like varied a lot, but using this you can use the original method and input six digits to create your own English poetry in the original Latin meter.

116
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:11.880
Kaeden Berg: Great.

117
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.940
Henry Koelling: Before we go we'd like to thank the yellow board for allowing us to present and all the other events.

118
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:34.950
Henry Koelling: throughout the week, and also the carleton college humanities Center student research partnership award which supported us in our initial research and you can visit our paper at tiny URL COM link below tiny URL COM slash.

119
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.390
Kaeden Berg: again.

120
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.670
Anastasia Salter: Okay cool Thank you.

121
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.670
Anastasia Salter: Next up, we have Dan McMullen with.

122
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.310
Anastasia Salter: gastro poetics text generation and the body.

123
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.520
Davin Heckman: hi i'm well, so I.

124
00:18:51.690 --> 00:19:02.430
Davin Heckman: Speaking of the body, and in reality and things like that and plan to put together a little like mini slideshow but the world conspired against me this morning.

125
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:14.880
Davin Heckman: So i'm just going to kind of highlight a couple points from the paper, but the paper you can find it and and read it and i'll try to get through it quickly here just my key points, and so, for those of you who aren't familiar with this.

126
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:29.970
Davin Heckman: gastro poetics sort of experiments that have taken place, the last couple elo conferences and there Scott rehberg and talent Mehmet have worked together to create tix generators that would would.

127
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.970
Davin Heckman: create these little poetic menus which they would then.

128
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:56.460
Davin Heckman: prepare for a handful of guests in real time, and so this is real food that real people would eat based on instructions given by a computer and I was thinking about and I had the chance because I live across the street from town, when I can see there's his house, you can see his house.

129
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.870
Davin Heckman: And I was hoping town would be here.

130
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.350
Davin Heckman: Right now actually but.

131
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.930
Davin Heckman: The.

132
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.020
Davin Heckman: The thing so i've been lucky to have a couple of meals as talent and Scott had been working on their.

133
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.550
Davin Heckman: text generators and get to test this out because it's it's.

134
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:30.960
Davin Heckman: Not just does it, you know it's not just a question of like Oh, are you getting good limericks out of the you know for the Limerick diet, or you know getting good quadrants from the quarantine quadrants.

135
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:39.360
Davin Heckman: But then the other part, is is you know, can the food be prepared in the time allowed and.

136
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.360
Davin Heckman: Is it any good to eat.

137
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.920
Davin Heckman: And it got me really thinking about this and.

138
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:56.850
Davin Heckman: What does this tell me about electronic literature and so that's kind of prompted this paper and so there's just a couple sort of ideas that i'd pull out.

139
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:13.050
Davin Heckman: That maybe you were thinking about one is to think about it in relationship in relation to certain sort of modernist experiments with food and cooking and one of the things I think that's kind of been common in in.

140
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:30.450
Davin Heckman: A lot of elite scholarship you know, are you know sort of different harmony guard movements and their impact on sort of how we think about experimental language, and you know yeah so you have you know sort of futurist food and you have.is food.

141
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.540
Davin Heckman: And surrealist food and then and fluxus food.

142
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:51.750
Davin Heckman: experiments and there's a lot of other sort of experiments with food in there, but thinking about those different sort of antecedents to Isla practice you when you look at sort of the the fluxus meals, I think.

143
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.480
Davin Heckman: are probably.

144
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.550
Davin Heckman: So a recreate tear of my ninja you know it has this body of.

145
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.850
Davin Heckman: Work, based around cooking and eating together, and I think you could look at those kinds of.

146
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:24.480
Davin Heckman: avant garde practices, and you know, think about you know what what each might bring to our consideration of Isla and and, if you think about it through the lens of sort of like gastro poetics well you know we can think about.

147
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.680
Davin Heckman: Are we are we considering you know.

148
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:43.800
Davin Heckman: Work that's obsessed with novelty, or are we thinking about experience, and I think that's something that you know, maybe would be a useful insight right we well, a lot of time in our field we think about novelty, we think about new approaches.

149
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:57.330
Davin Heckman: And oftentimes the question of experience, or what is happening to you get sidelined and so, as I was thinking through this project in relation to different avant garde practices i'm thinking well you know, like fluxus might be.

150
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:11.340
Davin Heckman: A place to go to think about ila for the future, another thing that that sort of I started to think about was this question of like Taylor ization and, like the scientific management approaches and how.

151
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:28.440
Davin Heckman: You know, human Labor gets rationalized right, and of course we live in a time where it's not just a person with a stopwatch measuring our emotions and sort of managing industrial production practices, but you know social practices now are sort of being engineered using.

152
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.360
Davin Heckman: Using platforms, and so we can think about.

153
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.440
Davin Heckman: You know the the degree to which the process of food production and consumption could be Taylor eyes.

154
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.760
Davin Heckman: and put that into conversation with a lot of other things that you know we experienced like grief love despair.

155
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:56.880
Davin Heckman: seduction joy relaxation, you know how did these things get captured and turned into different you know we come up with different kinds of Labor we call it Labor.

156
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:07.230
Davin Heckman: You know, sex work emotional Labor counseling self care right these all become sort of economic processes that that, especially in this age of social media right.

157
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:16.800
Davin Heckman: We turn even very idiosyncratic things like an inner personal conversation or a condolence or flirtation you know become these sort of.

158
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:33.690
Davin Heckman: Events that get data mined and analyzed and then optimized and then and then analyzed even further, and so we could think about you know what what that might do to our processes like eating right and and you know whether or not.

159
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:41.760
Davin Heckman: algorithmically generated food is good, I mean, I would argue taco bell right is is basically like.

160
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:58.950
Davin Heckman: A food algorithm right we have X ingredients, how do we create a new menu item based on those ingredients and that's what you get at taco bell and it's further helped along by you go in plugging thing in the kiosk and that's what you get and you know and does that constitute.

161
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.680
Davin Heckman: A nourishing experience.

162
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:10.410
Davin Heckman: And you know what are the other gratifications we think about when we think about eating also preparing food.

163
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:19.260
Davin Heckman: You know, it might be something we could bring over to electronic literature, more broadly, is just to think about gratifications in that way.

164
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:31.230
Davin Heckman: As well yeah definitely better than taco bell Scott, of course, but thinking about like a bad a bad example of machine generated food, maybe would be taco bell.

165
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:47.160
Davin Heckman: And, and then thinking about sort of this idea of grammar language and platform, and this is something that you know john kaylee's discussed quite a bit, but thinking about you know how behavior gets organized by norms and expect expectations.

166
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:53.100
Davin Heckman: You know, and then the degree to which our social life can reward deviation and surprise.

167
00:25:54.570 --> 00:26:02.940
Davin Heckman: In relation to normative expectations, and so you know we have this tension between sort of manners and customs that enable a kind of tactical play.

168
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:16.590
Davin Heckman: And that creates a occasions for some version and how do you digital platforms, you know challenge occasions of tactical subversion and how do those sorts of tactical subversion.

169
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:34.260
Davin Heckman: And that that sort of dialectic of pleasure and satisfaction was surprised how they made manifest at the table right because you don't want to be too terribly surprised when you sit down to eat a meal that it, you know makes you sick or tastes terrible.

170
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:48.450
Davin Heckman: And so you know these are these are another way to think about maybe you lead is like how to sort of localize it in specific events that we experience, rather than thinking about them against the general background of the backdrop of.

171
00:26:49.440 --> 00:27:02.400
Davin Heckman: technology industries in general i'm i'm over time so i'm gonna let it go there, so you can look at the paper, and you can find the links to everything i'm sorry to keep keep on going.

172
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:04.290
Davin Heckman: Thank you.

173
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.780
Anastasia Salter: Thank you.

174
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:13.980
Anastasia Salter: Last but not least, we have lior carlin with hunting pixels how gaming rethinks physical interactions.

175
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.700
Lyr Colin: Thank you yeah just.

176
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:25.320
Lyr Colin: offered by saying my people was actually the name currency but I usually for simplicity sake and as a preferred name so don't be surprised.

177
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:36.930
Lyr Colin: By that people was a word that is sort of the beginning of a reflection which I want to explore further as part of my ongoing research i'm a second year PhD students i'm very much of the beginning of.

178
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:47.460
Lyr Colin: The process, and I would say it's definitely less than precise project like the ones we just heard about which seen amazing and maybe more of the beginning of just the line of thoughts.

179
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:55.680
Lyr Colin: And so the main interest of the Paper itself was the kind of physical interactions that we can go through individual spaces.

180
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:14.880
Lyr Colin: And so, in order to discuss that I divided my reflection three different parts which I think would probably gain from being developed each into a form paper, but so the first one was sort of a more theoretical parts that looked at medium large as an intensity just gaming or anything.

181
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:25.140
Lyr Colin: But it must use cinema theory to sort of see how the notion of a strictly audio visual media or something to perceive a security visual usually can be.

182
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.300
Lyr Colin: Well, that notion can be contested and understood and border since oil terms and so.

183
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:37.050
Lyr Colin: I use specifically to reference this lauren marks on the one hand, and when Linda Williams from the other.

184
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:46.230
Lyr Colin: to sort of understand the media experience is something that it's kind of broader than just an individual experience and so lauren marks for instance I.

185
00:28:47.130 --> 00:29:03.600
Lyr Colin: sort of talked about this sense of a passive sensorial experience of the audience that sucked in you know everything around them so from its surroundings chaz the feeling of the of the seats under their butts that usually feel quite bad after two hours of movie.

186
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:14.730
Lyr Colin: You know the smell of food or just the smell of cinema theatre, which could have been cigarettes as well, I must mention in in other days.

187
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.820
Lyr Colin: or even the taste of popcorn which might be associated or in themselves to the experience of cinema going.

188
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:29.340
Lyr Colin: And so, all those experience she argued were integral parts of the cinema experience so sort of showing that it's not just an individual thing.

189
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:39.240
Lyr Colin: but rather something encompasses all their senses at once, which I thought was interesting for the rest of my of my paper and then Linda Williams.

190
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:53.550
Lyr Colin: I I thought she took a more active active sorry approach to audience ship with the idea that the media object itself could sort of transfer diabetic sensations such as you know, fear sadness horniness.

191
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.250
Lyr Colin: onto the viewer and so therefore have this sort of like more.

192
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.710
Lyr Colin: I guess active engagement of the viewer with them idiotic objects i'm so going with that sort of.

193
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:20.700
Lyr Colin: That sort of idea I went to my second part, which takes a closer look at gaming specifically Mr P geez so massively multiplayer on multiplayer sorry online or play games.

194
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:35.460
Lyr Colin: And how the player experience in them and where pjs engages a sense of physicality through through the Games Avatar and so here I sort of discussed the notion that I called disembodied physicality.

195
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:43.740
Lyr Colin: which, basically, I would say, consists in transferring one's own body perception and body language to a virtual Avatar.

196
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:51.240
Lyr Colin: which will, which will email, so we will make act as if it had its own sort of physical perceptions.

197
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:57.930
Lyr Colin: So, for instance I mentioned how players didn't use the avatars to convey a sense of body language and different situations with a you know emotes.

198
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:08.970
Lyr Colin: or even just you know jumping around i'm sure those of you have played in the mortgages know that when you meet someone you know, usually jump around them a lot and that's how they notice you don't say anything in the chat.

199
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:21.510
Lyr Colin: And, and often to the sort of idea that when you talk with someone online usually have your avatars meet up at some point if it's a lengthy conversation.

200
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:32.790
Lyr Colin: Even though you don't necessarily need that um to to happen, for the sake of the chat just not requiring physical proximity of the avatars.

201
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:42.810
Lyr Colin: um and then my third part is sort of took a closer look at vr and sort of more in comparison to my it's my second part as well.

202
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:53.040
Lyr Colin: And so sort of going from the idea that, unlike with Mr P geez Dr require the players direct physical involvement with a proper body of flesh and blood.

203
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:59.790
Lyr Colin: As as a part of the game, and so I wanted to think of how that engagement affected the notion of virtual physicality.

204
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:08.580
Lyr Colin: And that's, of course, since there is no more does embodiments, then I can actually talk about somebody physicality so instead I sort of coins.

205
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:16.950
Lyr Colin: A very weird and not easy to say word of fantasies yeah we're just supposed to have your play on synesthesia 10,000.

206
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:32.340
Lyr Colin: And, which is meant to reflect the sort of one sidedness sorry about that physical attractions in vr so, for instance, the idea that you know touching something or even someone specific games, by extending your your arm or.

207
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:40.560
Lyr Colin: You do so without receiving the appropriate haptic stimulus when when touching the objects not actually don't have any reaction.

208
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:49.740
Lyr Colin: you're basically touching the air and in an extended version of that paper I sort of discuss how, for instance, the game like beat saber.

209
00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:59.370
Lyr Colin: makes a clever use of the tools at hand to sort of producers simulacrum of haptic stimuli so by simply hitting a slight vibration whenever you cut a box right.

210
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:10.380
Lyr Colin: Which feels satisfying enough to sort of truly cancel out the sensation of you know, touching nothing or touching ghosts in the case of the the term I had.

211
00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:20.430
Lyr Colin: um so yeah this paper just comes from sort of more a set of personal experiences of my own online gaming experience and friendships.

212
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.680
Lyr Colin: And sort of just a bunch of reflection that I have wanted to have about the sort of peculiar.

213
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:35.310
Lyr Colin: Nature three of those interactions and you know why is it that being in an online game with someone hits differently than being on the chats or on a call, even with them.

214
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:43.830
Lyr Colin: And why does the game for such an immersive interaction in terms of just human contact beyond just you know what the game is supposedly for which is playing.

215
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:57.630
Lyr Colin: Even if it means of communication is something else So even if you're on discord you know boy chatting if this is an excellent communication by being present early in the game so yeah, thank you for letting me present here.

216
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:07.380
Anastasia Salter: Thank you, thank you to all of our presenters so fantastic set of generative.

217
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:15.390
Anastasia Salter: Discussions I look forward to getting a sense of our audience starts to bring this together.

218
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:35.640
Anastasia Salter: So there's been a few comments in the chat i'm not seeing any questions arise specifically yet other than that everything is in fact a sandwich and if taco bell serves on cocktails so like to kind of open this the floor either.

219
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.700
Anastasia Salter: raise your hand virtually, as it were, or.

220
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.900
Anastasia Salter: If you're on camera and want to wave it screen.

221
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:54.510
Anastasia Salter: ask you to unmute and get started Okay, you have one raised hands James.

222
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:56.610
James Ryan: yeah let me.

223
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.320
James Ryan: put down the hand that's always.

224
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:12.180
James Ryan: easy to forget awesome work very, very cool very happy to be among a lot more questions for zach um it's a simple simply my question is, does a computer generated book have to be computer generated.

225
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:18.330
James Ryan: and specifically i'm asking here about the operational this mode and you touched on this in the paper.

226
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:27.270
James Ryan: Talking about books like like beg a bone Am I die now, for instance from 1980 which, in my opinion, is not computer generated whatsoever, but was marketed as a book.

227
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:37.980
James Ryan: And it has a particular aesthetics in that operational mode, but I don't think it was computer generated, I still I have a copy and it's a prized possession, because I collect computer generated books and I counted among them.

228
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.390
James Ryan: what's your take on that there's a computer generated book have to be computer generated.

229
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.930
Zach Whalen (He|Him): know, I guess, because I think I think the way you described it there, I think, pretty.

230
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:56.310
Zach Whalen (He|Him): accurately says what I would say, which is that the the aesthetics of it or the idea that it was marketed that way has to do with the reception of it, and the way that.

231
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.830
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I mean the operational mode is is where you're.

232
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:06.660
Zach Whalen (He|Him): being pulled toward the process or being interested in the process, even if there is no process behind it like it's the active gesturing toward that process so it's almost a.

233
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:15.180
Zach Whalen (He|Him): rhetorical move to say, this is a computer generated generated book and I think for many of the examples that I mean like backbone and and.

234
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.250
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Please men's beard I mean there's some question about what actually happens before that book was printed.

235
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:28.860
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'm a little bit more interested in like the book after it's printed or after its produced and then discussed and almost the the conversation around the book is more interesting than.

236
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:34.110
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Then the actual process because we don't know it it's just the idea that it's presented as.

237
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:46.050
Zach Whalen (He|Him): As though this computer made it for different reasons, and I think I think I saw a Twitter thread where you're talking about vagabond and speculating about different motivations are possible origin stories for that that work, in other words, and like.

238
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.320
Zach Whalen (He|Him): happened thing in in travel on is another one where.

239
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.810
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Carol Kali is not exactly clear about how I mean she calls a computer assistant writing and so.

240
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:05.820
Zach Whalen (He|Him): There is some sense in which she used computation and she shows her work in some cases, but in other cases it's pretty clear that she just composed sentences that at least that's the way it reads to me.

241
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.200
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And so it to me it's operational just in the sense that we were interested in that process it's kind of held up as an example of computer generated art.

242
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:22.890
Zach Whalen (He|Him): And so that's but like reading it is actually reading the book actually understand the code, either we can't do it or it's it's not as interesting as that.

243
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.850
Zach Whalen (He|Him): particle move to say, this is a computer generated book and also other things like.

244
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:33.720
Zach Whalen (He|Him): A million random digits like technically that wasn't a computer that generated the random digits for that, I mean there's ways, you can you know.

245
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:47.220
Zach Whalen (He|Him): draw different kinds of boundaries around what it means to be computer generated, even though you know, and in some cases that boundary is simply like it's just a lie, or a hoax and that's that's interesting too, but yeah so yeah I included all.

246
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:56.910
James Ryan: cool one thing to add is a just a Jason phenomenon which which you'll be familiar with stuff like cigarette boy from 91 which.

247
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:07.560
James Ryan: Is in the style of a computer generated book, but was openly, not one conceptually it's that and there's a signal splat from 65 out of Denmark or Sweden.

248
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:24.540
James Ryan: Which is a similar kind of phenomenon but there it's not a hoax whatsoever it's openly not computer generated but it's exploring in a very you know concrete material manner What would it computers are rated book, you know look like and very similar to operations well cool.

249
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.230
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Thank you, interesting.

250
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.750
Anastasia Salter: And zach you also had your hand raise first last question or.

251
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.800
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Oh yeah I did have a question so um.

252
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.590
Zach Whalen (He|Him): How I put my hand down okay there we go um.

253
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.770
Zach Whalen (He|Him): So yeah a question for the artificial diversifier.

254
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.760
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Well, two questions so i'll just ask them both and you can go with whichever so the.

255
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.190
Last night gallery view.

256
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.940
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah in the opening bit, I think, in her you talked a little bit about.

257
00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:05.460
Zach Whalen (He|Him): We don't know Peters process we don't know exactly how we did it, except that it took him 12 years but i'm i'm I imagine that you must have gained.

258
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:12.000
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Some pretty significant insight into that process by reverse engineering it and recreating it i'm wondering.

259
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:22.410
Zach Whalen (He|Him): If you could say more about that or like what you speculate his process was or what you learned in reproducing the the method what what.

260
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:32.280
Zach Whalen (He|Him): aspects of that competition seems like steps that Peters must have taken like things that you did that Peters must have done originally and not and that's question number one if you have any thoughts about that.

261
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:46.890
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Also, do you know if anyone if there were, because in the paper you talked about how this was a fairly popular system, it was reprinted reprinted at least two or three times or indifferent edition, so people knew about it, and and probably SWIFT was referencing it in the.

262
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:51.030
Zach Whalen (He|Him): exhibit the thing from gulliver's travels so there's.

263
00:39:52.800 --> 00:40:05.640
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Are there any examples of like printed as like poetry generated by the Latin versus fire either in collections, or in other cases, in other words, did people actually read in and publish and read the poetry that it produced that you know.

264
00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.980
Henry Koelling: and take the first part, so.

265
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.000
Zach Whalen (He|Him): One thing I failed.

266
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.930
To mention.

267
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.030
Henry Koelling: Was the marketing scheme that john Peter used.

268
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:34.620
Henry Koelling: So the whole purpose for this project was to make producing Latin verse easy for anybody, it was marketed towards school children um and I guess in.

269
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:43.320
Henry Koelling: During our translation process our goal was to keep that simplicity.

270
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:45.600
Henry Koelling: apparent.

271
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:52.050
Henry Koelling: In doing so, I definitely ran across some challenges um.

272
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:58.290
Henry Koelling: But i'm not sure if that totally answered your question, maybe King James do you guys have other things.

273
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.060
Kaeden Berg: I can talk a little bit about some of the processes, he used to make this.

274
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.930
Kaeden Berg: Latin is really nice because of the flexible word order you can look at things different ways.

275
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:21.150
Kaeden Berg: Once you've read the whole sentence like I know there's some lines like famous Cicero things where he speaks for like half a page and then the verb for the sentence is all the way at the end, and it changes everything.

276
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:39.270
Kaeden Berg: Because of the kind of flexible word order, this is one thing we weren't able to really grasp and capture thought translation words can be switched so there's the first table is primarily nouns the second table here actually pull up our we have a little sheet that explains everything.

277
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:50.490
Kaeden Berg: Each table represents a different part of speech for the actual sentence, but like the first and the fifth or both Downs but either could be the subject either could be the object of the verb.

278
00:41:52.200 --> 00:42:00.510
Kaeden Berg: So this is the way he actually gives it more flexibility where technically there's like the 500,000 different outputs, but if we start switching the ID.

279
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:10.410
Kaeden Berg: and be transmitted, you can read it possibly millions of different ways the scrambling method he used, we also uncovered it's pretty simple it's like.

280
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:18.030
Kaeden Berg: We got the word banks and then first letter of each word isn't a nine letter sequence, and then the second letter of each words after that, and so on.

281
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:26.670
Kaeden Berg: Until one of the word ends and there's a black box and for its place in the sequence of random letter he is just puts then after that.

282
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:42.600
James Ryan: i'll just add one thing to that that we discovered right at the end when we're putting together our tape which was actually done for this paper we would have done it anyway, but that was the point at which we can post those we noticed that we had the black boxes which terminate each.

283
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:49.170
James Ryan: Each table is a word bank with nine words distributed in an arcane manner to make it more mystical.

284
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:58.020
James Ryan: And then the black boxes terminate each word on his table these black boxes come right at the end because the words are of the same length generally.

285
00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:06.360
James Ryan: With some discrepancy in ours they're kind of coming all over which is static, we had a different look, and I think probably reveals more of the underlying process.

286
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.900
James Ryan: And if you just looking in see where the black boxes are distributed.

287
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:18.270
James Ryan: As far as the second question on outputs where they studied where they celebrated discussed compiled into a booklet or something like that.

288
00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:25.830
James Ryan: I would love to see that a search for things like that, to my knowledge, the extent of the outputs that we've seen.

289
00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:31.440
James Ryan: And we can generate all of them ourselves all 500,000 the extent of ones that i've seen that were historically printed.

290
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.560
James Ryan: Are the British Museum holds one copy of the original booklet and somebody wrote.

291
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:47.700
James Ryan: In pen one generated output that they did, and they actually produced the English translation of it so that's the only case we've seen an attempt at translating the system at all.

292
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:56.520
James Ryan: Besides stuff in the 21st century and then other cases would be in not in newspapers, but in periodicals of the.

293
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.750
James Ryan: much later in the 19th century cases of there's this wild system and here's one example out but but not taking it seriously.

294
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:10.470
James Ryan: We talked to a lot nest at carleton college, where we are, who said, the original versus just horrible it's absolutely.

295
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:25.080
James Ryan: horrible original verse it's Latin if you're generous it's certainly Latin it sex amateur for sure, but the meanings are very strange it's a difficult problem like we discovered so um I don't think people take the elements that seriously they're interested with system itself.

296
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.180
Anastasia Salter: All right, we have a follow up question from will tell me.

297
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:42.090
Anastasia Salter: Picking up from the first thread, the possibility of computer generated books that were not generated by a computer begs the question of whether there can be books.

298
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:51.630
Anastasia Salter: That were generated by a computer that are not including the category of computer generated books So where are the boundaries and do we still need boundaries.

299
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.900
Anastasia Salter: anyone wants to pick up that provocation.

300
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.650
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I mean, I did kind of intentionally sidestep that question of.

301
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.020
Zach Whalen (He|Him): What do we mean by generated right because.

302
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.990
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Like unless you're being super article every book is.

303
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.220
Anastasia Salter: At some point.

304
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:16.950
Zach Whalen (He|Him): In some version on a computer and so and so like we cannot maybe it's a spectrum where continue on the degrees of generated this or something I.

305
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:29.130
Zach Whalen (He|Him): mean even writing a word processor may influence the way that you compose your tax and so on, so there's ways in which you are you kind of can't not be doing computer assisted writing do you tell my colleagues word but I mean, I think.

306
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:38.790
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Like i'm what i'm thinking of things like you know born digital literature that is is like maybe it's conceived digitally put it's.

307
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:47.100
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Born physically I don't know there's the metaphor is getting mango but the idea is that there's there's some kind of computational algorithmic or or generative.

308
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:53.490
Zach Whalen (He|Him): process in the way that we normally identify electronic literature, so I view this ultimately as a genre of electronic literature, where.

309
00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:00.060
Zach Whalen (He|Him): We we've got different ways of talking about what we mean by that but, generally, we mean something programmatic something.

310
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:16.200
Zach Whalen (He|Him): You know alien story stochastic or or procedural I mean it's different words and put in there, but at least that's what i'm interested in in in ways in which the author is removed and some sort of processes put in place of that so some kind of digital processes suppose.

311
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.910
Zach Whalen (He|Him): But of course the great thing about throwing out these kind of definitions is that we all might disagree about where we draw those lines, and then we can talk about it, and you know different.

312
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:32.490
Zach Whalen (He|Him): conference papers and whatever else but yeah it's it's, it is the big question right it's a good one, I just I don't know I i'm not.

313
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:42.180
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Having spent a lot of time thinking about where I draw that line, other than that, I think I think computer generated books as electronic literature so it's the same kind of line that I would draw around that term in other.

314
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:44.190
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Other.

315
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.280
Zach Whalen (He|Him): medium mediums I guess.

316
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.420
Anastasia Salter: Where the line is an electronic literature's already same speed at this.

317
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.430
Anastasia Salter: Much you can do with that alright we're going next.

318
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:06.480
Lyr Colin: I think yeah I had a question for them, and I was just wondering, because you talk about this.

319
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:18.030
Lyr Colin: limit diet, I think game that you did for for generating menus and I was wondering, because there is a poetic element of courses limericks and and I just wondered how the political dimension, fits into the menu.

320
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.320
Lyr Colin: Or if it was something wasn't necessarily considered and you just sort of took the ingredients that came up.

321
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:28.320
Lyr Colin: So I guess how does poetry translate into into food or into a cuisine.

322
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:36.090
Davin Heckman: So the the yeah the the output is and actually scott's in the room and Scott.

323
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:54.840
Davin Heckman: did some of the did the work with talent on designing that the text generator but you know which you do you receive as a guest right is that is that menu that's a series of limericks that have been generated by the machine, so you do actually get a Limerick, and so.

324
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:56.970
Davin Heckman: From the.

325
00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.160
Davin Heckman: From the.

326
00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.070
Scott Rettberg: Often, a very poor Limerick that doesn't scan.

327
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:10.050
Davin Heckman: But you know I mean The thing is, is that there's they're loose and they're very playful but.

328
00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.830
Davin Heckman: You know you, you get a.

329
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.930
Davin Heckman: You know if you are getting a cast with your meal.

330
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:27.000
Davin Heckman: And part of it is you know the other part, I guess that the game is that, depending on how it's played at the beginning.

331
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:42.330
Davin Heckman: there's a card game where you construct your your dealt cards and you trade cards and you create a cocktail to the card game, and if you sort of you know you get points for your cocktail.

332
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.160
Davin Heckman: and

333
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:52.140
Davin Heckman: You you can then based on the points that you've accumulated through drinking, you can you get priority.

334
00:48:53.520 --> 00:49:08.370
Davin Heckman: selection of the menu because everybody gets a different meal and so you can be choosy but I mean it's all it's all very good food, but it adds an element of risk there right because the drinks, on the other hand, are not always very good.

335
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.510
Davin Heckman: Sometimes they're they're quite shocking.

336
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.480
Davin Heckman: yeah I don't know if that answers your question.

337
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:27.420
Scott Rettberg: I think a big thing for us was that the poetry was part of it.

338
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:35.730
Scott Rettberg: It but it, but it was also poetry to kind of create an occasion for performance.

339
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:44.520
Scott Rettberg: And although having said that there's there's quite a bit of a variable structure involved and.

340
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.100
Scott Rettberg: And I think both the both of the two generative systems.

341
00:49:51.750 --> 00:50:00.210
Scott Rettberg: You know, played thematically in interesting ways with kind of the contemporary situation, the last one quarantine quite trends.

342
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:07.440
Scott Rettberg: sort of had a lot of play with that and this initial stage of being in the pandemic.

343
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:19.500
Scott Rettberg: And, and I think the quarter thing to both of them, though, is the idea of the word, made flesh and also the word made poetic meeting.

344
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:24.480
Scott Rettberg: The sort of generation as generating.

345
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:30.390
Scott Rettberg: kind of a communal human experience was interesting to us.

346
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:53.520
Davin Heckman: I have a question and as thinking about sort of humans, creating machine generated texts and those boundaries, and I think your rights act like to think about you know, creating a sort of clear demarcation between the sorts of things that are you know part of nano general.

347
00:50:54.570 --> 00:51:11.310
Davin Heckman: But then other kinds of machine generated texts that we should be thinking about and, like the post digital context and those would be things that are you know first there's like these various experience experiments with like exploitation, where you're hiring people to serve.

348
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:23.610
Davin Heckman: Certain sort of economic interests and using sort of structural strategic any qualities to get people in or parts of the world to write texts.

349
00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:25.770
Davin Heckman: to serve.

350
00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.530
Davin Heckman: You know the the.

351
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.550
Davin Heckman: to serve a sort of automated global economy.

352
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:45.360
Davin Heckman: Which is a kind of machine writing there's also this sort of writing that journalists increasingly do, which is to write for search engine optimization.

353
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:51.930
Davin Heckman: And then the other kind of writing that we all sort of get asked to do, which is.

354
00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:06.180
Davin Heckman: Driven by sort of behavioral economics and platform design, which is sort of to constantly prompt us to be doing a kind of machine readable writing of our lives, and you know I don't know those.

355
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:11.850
Davin Heckman: should be kept, I think, is distinct category from these specific kinds of.

356
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.580
Davin Heckman: Creative aesthetic practices, but I also think they they might.

357
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:28.080
Davin Heckman: be useful to think of alongside those kinds of writing practices as well, I don't know if you had any thoughts or anyone has thoughts about that.

358
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.750
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah I think that there's some important considerations, along the lines of what we think about.

359
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.240
Zach Whalen (He|Him): You know text generation or.

360
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:43.320
Zach Whalen (He|Him): automated writing systems and there's a whole conversation to be had around that you raised a lot of great points.

361
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:50.130
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I think one of the things you might be thinking of actually one of my examples was emerging deck which I believe was made with the mechanical.

362
00:52:50.460 --> 00:53:03.270
Zach Whalen (He|Him): mechanical Turk, with the amazons thing, and so you can think of that as a kind of you know exploitive Labor kind of thing you're asking people to do this silly thing for you to make this sort of art book and now paying them basically nothing and so.

363
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:11.340
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah I mean I definitely I think that's an important thing to be aware of and thinking about like when we think about these audiences and I think a lot of these works.

364
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:19.290
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Some of these works, I think, directly address the kind of economic and Labor issues and questions around book production and printing, especially the artistic print on demand.

365
00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:30.390
Zach Whalen (He|Him): that's something that i've only kind of recently started learning more about, but things like the black book it's 700 something pages of fully black ink with the premise is to maximize the.

366
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:39.780
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Basically maximize the cost to lulu to print it to make live, you know and so it's it's it's kind of forcing lulu to spend more money.

367
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:51.780
Zach Whalen (He|Him): On ink printing this document there's another one that there's also a blank book I forget the authors of it but it's another it's the same premise, but in reverse and so it's a completely blank book that you can print from Lewis like 700 pages, but it's like price that.

368
00:53:52.590 --> 00:54:04.500
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I think that, because you can set the price a little I think they price it at a million dollars for this blank book so in these are ways in which these artists are playing with those questions of how we produce text and circulated as a an artifact and that's why I think.

369
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:07.800
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah I think that's why it's interesting.

370
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:15.330
Zach Whalen (He|Him): The conversation i'm trying to the way i'm trying to shift away i'm thinking about this is less about different methods or context we're generating texts so much as.

371
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:19.470
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Like what what is the moment when you decide to print this or make this from.

372
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:31.920
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Your transition from a process or technique or an idea into a product like a material physical thing in some cases, most in many cases, talking about physical things you can hold and flip through and put on your shelf and collect and.

373
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.380
Zach Whalen (He|Him): and trade, I mean there's an interesting way that we take it offline when we do that and that's.

374
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:49.650
Zach Whalen (He|Him): It you know that there are lots of reasons why you might do that, but often they would those reasons, end up addressing some of those same questions you raised about like the economic and Labor conditions around producing these things.

375
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:52.020
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah.

376
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.560
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I don't know if that answered your question or anything but I just think that I was thinking about.

377
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.800
Anastasia Salter: A few other.

378
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:12.570
Anastasia Salter: comments, as well as some suggested readings in the chat and Andrew saying those examples make going sound reasonable which.

379
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.780
Anastasia Salter: Another was gone through, it can go quite that far.

380
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:24.660
Anastasia Salter: ends on your perspective on environmental impact katie and connections, the artists book tradition.

381
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:29.820
Anastasia Salter: Anyone like to jump in and pick up on those themes or asked another question.

382
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:33.840
Anastasia Salter: games.

383
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:37.560
Anastasia Salter: yeah.

384
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.870
James Ryan: i'll defer to kayden because i've already asked a question what a pretty.

385
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.760
Anastasia Salter: Good okay.

386
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.100
Kaeden Berg: I had a question for Lear.

387
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.540
Kaeden Berg: At the end of your paper you kind of mentioned that, like so.

388
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:55.260
Kaeden Berg: In vr chat for set though it may be kind of have like a hug with a harmless might glitch out but it's you still kind of feel that connection.

389
00:55:55.650 --> 00:56:05.190
Kaeden Berg: I was curious maybe in your experience how much religion realism immersion is an important part of feeling this physical connection and how much do glitches end up taking you out of it.

390
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:11.910
Kaeden Berg: Do you think there's like a strong suspension of belief, for things to be a little unrealistic like you understand you're both in vr.

391
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.150
Kaeden Berg: And do you think that when the industry moves towards more realism and immersion this will become more jarring.

392
00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.440
Lyr Colin: I think you um.

393
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:27.780
Lyr Colin: yeah I think it's something that's like a little bit more on a more extreme version of the other paper, but I think.

394
00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:40.560
Lyr Colin: that's what it tries to discover the fantasy, just like this sense of the glitch being almost irrelevant and the fact that you're you're hiding the elec very conscious, you know that you're just doing this in your bedroom on your own, which is very sad.

395
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:51.690
Lyr Colin: You kind of go go past that because I think that there's the knowledge that someone else on the other side, where they are is doing the exact same thing.

396
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:59.700
Lyr Colin: ends up being more important than the actual glitch so, at least from my own experience I don't think that there was any sense of.

397
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:10.650
Lyr Colin: Engineering you know feeling of of, as I mentioned, like you know hugging Dr are hugging pixels but rather there's an importance of just the shared experience and of.

398
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:23.520
Lyr Colin: Of the shared moments and that's why I think I talked about hugging ghosts rather than hugging you know nothing because it's as if you know, there was something that you simply just can touch that is there, but it is still there.

399
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.850
Lyr Colin: So yeah hopefully that answers the question.

400
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:40.950
Anastasia Salter: James.

401
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:42.630
Anastasia Salter: That question.

402
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.780
James Ryan: yeah it's actually a comment it's also pretty clear.

403
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.960
James Ryan: Especially when you use the terminology.

404
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:57.750
James Ryan: verbiage of ghosts it's calling to mind a really interesting phenomenon I don't know if it's been written about in this Community or others of.

405
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:07.920
James Ryan: You know, like racing games, where you can record your play through and then play against I think it's called a ghost run or something or a ghost or something like that.

406
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:14.370
James Ryan: read this really interesting blog post or something, this is probably 10 years ago and it was this guy writing.

407
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:20.130
James Ryan: About growing up playing Mario kart I think on the we are gamekeeper something with his dad.

408
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:25.950
James Ryan: and his dad always beat him and his dad had this like ghost run on one of this level that was so fast.

409
00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:33.270
James Ryan: And he would be able to play against his dad when his dad couldn't physically play with them at work and things like that and trying to beat this running he never could.

410
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:42.900
James Ryan: Then his dad passed away when he was very young and he continued to play against this ghost in Mario kart of his dad and eventually got better than his dad and ever been.

411
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:51.600
James Ryan: and was able to beat it, but you can always go back to the SAVE on this game cube which became a prize physical possession, because it could be countered his dad there.

412
00:58:52.470 --> 00:59:04.110
James Ryan: As literally this kind of ghosts made concrete in a digital sense seems like a phenomenon that maybe it's a Jason but, but your word called it to mind, and I think it's really interesting phenomenon.

413
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.670
Lyr Colin: And I think it's it's very interesting and I hadn't thought about it.

414
00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:15.570
Lyr Colin: In that way, with you know, especially the racing game where there is a sense of playing against someone, but I know there's been even more pages like.

415
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:24.630
Lyr Colin: Cases where i'm thinking of Guild wars two, but like cases where someone spouse had died and they made that person to an npc inside the game.

416
00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:40.200
Lyr Colin: And so, people would come and pay tribute to that npc and including you know, of course, the the styles coming through to that person and sort of you know interacting with it in whatever way they could, so I know it is a thing that you need to pay tribute to a to a deceased person.

417
00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:52.920
Lyr Colin: Inside again but yeah I think there's something very special about what you talked about which is this idea of interacting even with the or competing against someone who's already not there anymore, thank you.

418
00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.750
Anastasia Salter: Lots of great suggestions and.

419
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:02.190
Anastasia Salter: snack.

420
01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:19.140
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah i'm i'm trying, this is for devin i'm trying to give my thoughts into into the shape of a question, but there are a lot of really interesting provocations in your paper, a lot of really compelling ways of expressing different.

421
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:27.780
Zach Whalen (He|Him): I guess anxiety and insights about our present moment and and kind of using gas or poet X to kind of read into some of those things it really just.

422
01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:41.790
Zach Whalen (He|Him): really interesting stuff I just to kind of maybe just one sort of pointing that I might be useful, and maybe nibble on a little bit you're you're closing sentence, you talk about and you kind of call for.

423
01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:51.930
Zach Whalen (He|Him): there's a sense of like resistance or a sense of like you know platforms are kind of doing this to us, but we can we can do other things in these kind of use this phrase early like para.

424
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:59.550
Zach Whalen (He|Him): para digital occasions and you kind of call for you know billions of these are you recognize that these are these are things that we should be.

425
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:15.630
Zach Whalen (He|Him): Celebrating and moving toward things like natural products, so I guess just to maybe give you a way to respond to it, if you want to you do think of this idea of para digital occasions, do you think computer generated books could be that kind of thing or.

426
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:26.700
Zach Whalen (He|Him): The kind of emotive connections that we're talking about in the paper, I mean are these examples of what you're you're looking for and kind of pulling for at the end of your paper.

427
01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:34.830
Davin Heckman: Well, so I mean there's I think definitely right like there's a chapter actually in talents dissertation on.

428
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.950
Davin Heckman: On Toronto gorge and it's like kind of I think it was written when maybe there was just like a couple.

429
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.220
Davin Heckman: A couple.

430
01:01:45.540 --> 01:02:00.540
Davin Heckman: Derivatives of that work right but it's called the little engine that could, and he talks about sort of what what is the real sort of accomplishment of the work, and you know it's.

431
01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:11.100
Davin Heckman: You know, thinking about you know what a work is right, we often have this descriptive way of experiencing digital works, because they're these technical objects and.

432
01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:24.420
Davin Heckman: You know that's kind of you know, the moment we've been you know kind of stuck in for a long time, and because novelty being what it is, you know it's a work is always superseded, but I think that you know.

433
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:34.080
Davin Heckman: literary works have always been creative they've always been invented but, at the heart of them right that there's some kind of.

434
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:48.720
Davin Heckman: set of gratifications and these gratifications are very you know their singular they they you know I often when I read a work that I really like and i'm sure that many people have this experience, I feel like.

435
01:02:50.280 --> 01:03:05.250
Davin Heckman: Somehow i'm this work was written by somebody who knows me in some way right that there's something that we have in common, as we encounter this together, or that i'm seeing a piece of it, and you know it could be that on just a narcissist.

436
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:17.190
Davin Heckman: You know, but I think that this is one of the attractions of literary work right, and this is why we think of literature is kind of consistent with the rise of the self, you know as a historical.

437
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:31.620
Davin Heckman: Construction but this idea that you know what is the wonder, and what is the experience that the work opens up and i'm willing to say that you know just about any kind of work could.

438
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:47.310
Davin Heckman: unlock that experience, even on accident for people sometimes you see something, and you think it was left there on purpose for you, but it was just an accident, but you know getting in touch with that the sort of downstream sort of.

439
01:03:49.080 --> 01:04:06.450
Davin Heckman: gratifications of the work rather than you know, describing it, you know, in a in a technical way you know it might be something that you know we we really learn to enjoy and rediscover you know I worry sometimes that.

440
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:17.460
Davin Heckman: You know, we might miss out on what an accomplishment of work, you know, like you think about something like seeing Spar between which.

441
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:28.440
Davin Heckman: that's that work is technically interesting and you can point to that sort of technical fact of its existence as.

442
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:34.680
Davin Heckman: A feat of you know, engineering or something like that, but I think that the.

443
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:51.000
Davin Heckman: Experience the phenomenal logical experience of the work offers much more than that, and you know, so I would say yeah right that that yeah of course machine generated work could provide these occasions, but it might be like a kind of you know, a.

444
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:59.970
Davin Heckman: Critical practice that you know, to really do heavy some kind of reader response, the approach in our field.

445
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:07.560
Davin Heckman: Why, why do Why is a work pleasurable is a really good question always.

446
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:26.430
Lyr Colin: Had a question for the artificial versifying.

447
01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.020
Lyr Colin: panels.

448
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:37.710
Lyr Colin: And I was wondering when I was sort of reading your paper and I sort of played around with your translation tables that she did instead of like trying to make my own.

449
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:49.020
Lyr Colin: My own verses and, at least from from the the one they saw that you translate and then the ones I try to make myself, it seemed like there was some kind of a unifying theme, to the.

450
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:59.190
Lyr Colin: To the possibility of verses and I was wondering if it was just something that happens to be lucky about if there was something you noticed about about this.

451
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:06.060
Lyr Colin: I guess verse generation that has a central theme to it, which would, I guess, mean that there was some kind of.

452
01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:19.980
Lyr Colin: tailoring of those 500,000 plus possibilities that you mentioned so did you did you notice anything like that there was some kind of intent behind all of these many, many possibilities of versus or.

453
01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:22.830
Lyr Colin: yeah.

454
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.910
James Ryan: it's just a great question it's the thing of three people.

455
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:40.470
James Ryan: i'll be happy to at least start in say that, certainly in john Peters original verse his original, we can say 54 words, which are the.

456
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.950
James Ryan: Words in the respective word banks.

457
01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:57.210
James Ryan: Certainly in the in that case the original versus have a kind of morose macabre aesthetic to them there's a certain definitely a coherent, the matic.

458
01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:05.370
James Ryan: thrust there, which was certainly intentional on caden Henry and, if you want to add on to to that notion.

459
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:25.020
Kaeden Berg: yeah I think kind of that morose feeling comes from the adjectives themselves the second table all adjectives are pretty negative it's things like wild ugly rough dirty disloyal dishonest it's, not a single like positive adjective in really in the entire thing.

460
01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:28.290
Kaeden Berg: I think that kind of gives it that.

461
01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.200
Kaeden Berg: rose or darker feeling but also.

462
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:47.280
Kaeden Berg: it's very all the verses we've produced some very serious they're talking about wars or like pledges they seem to all be describing something, but the human condition of like tarnish deeds will display palpable battles or something.

463
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:59.040
Kaeden Berg: They all seem to follow the same idea of this is why the world works, the way it is, which is not always the case in land poetry it's interesting that john Peters chose to focus on that.

464
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:10.680
Zach Whalen (He|Him): started typing a question but, since no one else is talking maybe we could just jump in and ask a follow up on that because.

465
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:20.400
Zach Whalen (He|Him): i'm really curious about that, like why like What was it about john Peters world that that led him to sort of write poetry, that would be so kind of pessimistic or.

466
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:27.450
Zach Whalen (He|Him): You know so dark I mean this is a 17th century England, I guess, I don't know what was your what was going on back then.

467
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:41.460
Zach Whalen (He|Him): So i'm wondering if it can be just in responding to his you know idea of what is going on, or if it's like his way of writing something getting things people will see as like good poetry like his idea sort of appealing to this sort of seriousness and.

468
01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:54.540
Zach Whalen (He|Him): yeah thanks they I think they weren't great, but the point is, you know I can I can imagine two possible motivations for him and i'm for him to kind of arrive at that the compositional strategy and i'm just curious, if you think either one of those makes sense.

469
01:08:56.490 --> 01:08:58.710
Henry Koelling: I think there's definitely an element of.

470
01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.350
Henry Koelling: romanticism going on.

471
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.100
Henry Koelling: Which kind of ties in with.

472
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.810
Henry Koelling: You know the way the way the booklet is presented as like this major breakthrough.

473
01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:22.050
Henry Koelling: To produce an inverse for anybody, no matter their educational background.

474
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:33.210
Henry Koelling: We we have like very little knowledge of john john peer I believe was a mathematician.

475
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:35.520
James Ryan: position actually.

476
01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:36.450
Henry Koelling: Is it.

477
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.850
James Ryan: says polymath.

478
01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:41.010
James Ryan: Know position isn't he was a doctor.

479
01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:42.660
Henry Koelling: Oh okay.

480
01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:51.180
James Ryan: there's one source that says that and I haven't been able to find much on this life, but apparently was a doctor near the time of a plague event.

481
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.250
James Ryan: Was Leah said in the chat there's a big fire that time too, so.

482
01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:04.410
James Ryan: Life was maybe dark for him, even though he's you know, had a relatively high status and so forth in London didn't mean to cut you off Henry.

483
01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:15.990
James Ryan: yeah so obviously that would feed into it, if we were all the right land examiner might be darker than if we were to in 2019 2018 it was coming out of a plague event.

484
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:34.470
James Ryan: But I think my hunch personally in these folks are the Latin scholars on the team, but my hunch personally is that he's engaging in a in a Meta tradition of Latin you know Latin being at the Center of scholastic life for nearly two millennia, by the time he was working with it.

485
01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:40.650
James Ryan: there's so many different traditions of Latin diverse he's working in this particular tradition which.

486
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:56.490
James Ryan: we're not experts in but in the 17th century in London, I don't know exactly what Latin verse meant, then I would assume he's engaging what particular kinds of static values that would be conventional in the verse any one of these outputs still look like conventional and next amateur.

487
01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:05.430
James Ryan: that's, something that would be like further exploration we scratched the surface, a bit, but didn't dive deep there it's a great question.

488
01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:13.980
Anastasia Salter: we're coming up on time but stephanie getting the last question your thoughts.

489
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:17.130
Stephanie Strickland: yeah I question whether.

490
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:27.030
Stephanie Strickland: The way that thing was constructed was necessarily he was looking to write a specific kind of verse, especially if all these words have nine letters and.

491
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:35.250
Stephanie Strickland: It seems to me that that might be the those might be the words that he found fit into a system better.

492
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:51.990
Stephanie Strickland: than another set I think that's far more likely than that he set out to write a specific kind of thing and then trying to fit it in it's like doing really hard crossword puzzles to you know with oh i'll just choose my words I think it's I think it's probably driven the other way.

493
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.890
James Ryan: Okay.

494
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.120
James Ryan: I speak immediate great point.

495
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:07.980
Kaeden Berg: could also agree with that, I think a lot of the vocabulary and some of the tables definitely felt like he was looking for.

496
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:15.630
Kaeden Berg: A word in a specific case around a specific length to just make the tables look right there are definitely times when.

497
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:32.430
Kaeden Berg: The object like they're often talk about like the, this is what causes battles and it produces vows but then there's one night stars, which always make the versus the nonsensical like augment night stars, or will give up night stars.

498
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:49.140
Kaeden Berg: It sometimes it does create these kind of nonsensical versus because it seems like he was trying to generate ideas, based on like previous Latin he's possibly read because, like talking about night stars or talking about times and ideas are somewhat common.

499
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:55.260
Stephanie Strickland: But his night stars have an astrological meaning of some kind in this context.

500
01:12:55.530 --> 01:13:00.300
Kaeden Berg: It could mean constellations it usually it's just literally the word for like the night sky.

501
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:12.000
Kaeden Berg: But often the verses are talking about like tangible objects or like ideas you can move and work with night stars always seems very.

502
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.890
Kaeden Berg: I guess fixed.

503
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:21.390
Kaeden Berg: it's not something like you can really change so it's always interesting to find generated poem from this that is talking about that.

504
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:29.880
Anastasia Salter: That brings us exactly to our time.

505
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:40.920
Anastasia Salter: Thank you again to our panelists and for everyone for engaging and bringing up all these fantastic examples lots to explore.

506
