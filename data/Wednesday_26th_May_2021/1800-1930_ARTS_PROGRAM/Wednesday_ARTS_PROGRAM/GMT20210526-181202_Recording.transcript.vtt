yuzhu: Tolerance i've seen guys show, fortunately, some portion to signs and we can see sure.

217
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.620
yuzhu: Like the image of a stereotypical programmer.

218
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.980
yuzhu: I hunter over to dusk thinking about the time that I fell into the stream.

219
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.850
yuzhu: The more I chew on this tool, the slower, it becomes.

220
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.360
yuzhu: I think it is also exhausting.

221
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.430

insincere protective.

234
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.000
Simply.

235
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:06.090
flashes and reels are laughter impertinence was fine and spiteful glass.

236
00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:16.170
The modified body, who synergy you care stay until a split and warning and unreality so.

237
00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.720
bleak and then we.

238
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.850
recognize nothing.

239
00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:23.490
really happened.

240
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.190
rummaging through the box to.

241
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.350
Each of her hymns.

242
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.930
Is the manuscript which.

243
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:32.820
A few verses.

244
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.460
can turn.

245
00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.010
porn.

246
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:28.530
reminding everyone, not of justice, but events which are the poet's foreshadowing for an unexpected irreversible.

247
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.810
What shall we take from this, what about the bush, what does it matter.

248
00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:15.750
Paper was said to become overinflated that it's calculated the disinherited.

249
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.540
channel.

250
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.460
As the vapor.

251
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:30.150
in miniature which was cultivated images like a diminutive diagram dementia, with the candidate.

252
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:39.030
or they had so the type of sparkling water, which was supposed to do something or neutralize effects that.

253
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:48.240
Did anything for health easily bone gets put into terms of numbers, given the right materials for the rod equations.

254
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:58.620
The time for movement which innovation of one of the druids can now be reckoned on one of the agricultural grids was estimated on what he called the comedy tablet later human.

255
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:03.360
you'll note as the color a splinter in can be accumulated in more than one way.

256
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:15.450
This was not possible to do in the tablet later, which cost it's maker, to abandon the project and engage in the botanical analysis of herbal threads the authentication of the lucknow tendencies of the shrimp this criminal.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:30.030
Other calculator it was clear that the only evidence of criminality was active in version, it was clear that this was not productive.

259
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:43.350
Undermining most of the critiques but repetitive, that is, it was not true eventful analysis, but the reproduction of event which, for all the many parameters to keep constant would consistently create random variations.

260
00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:53.130
The harsh of the performance dipped completely in the self and the preservation of pigments and liquid combination with not rivers, but the same corpse in each defense of violence in.

261
00:46:53.370 --> 00:47:07.410
The idea of the desolation of the now entirely obscured figure was the case of continuity, the manicure of simmering spiral inflation syndrome and the comedy tabulate a record in the most wretched of terms reprimanded for a more consistent result.

262
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.200
Ian Hatcher: Thank you Eric that was beautiful.
