00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Thank you Sarah that was fantastic.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Um, so I'm going to start us recording.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
See,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and welcome again to the second day of performances for you know low.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
2021. That was just Sarah Rafa with video off zoom and pandemic productivity, not captured on video but captured in our hearts.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That was great.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Um, I wanted to also begin as I did yesterday with expressing gratitude to the other three members of the performance curatorial committee Claire Donato Astrid insolent and Katniss, as well as to everybody organizing the conference, Scott and sore and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Carlo who very helpfully just reminded me to turn off the things as people were coming in.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So thank you for saving that performance from that, Carla.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So up Second, we have Jessica Rodriguez, within the Casio nice slash settings.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And if everyone could just keep themselves muted and with their video off I have less of a.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But if people pop in I may, I may meet you in such Jessica, are you all set and what's the baby cam, regrettably.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There we go.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Forest morality.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Be suave Szymborska.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
She enters the forest.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And actually gets lost in it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
She knows it inside and out.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
migratory departure and arrival.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
She feels free and the other have a branch.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And its shadows and after shadows.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
green volts.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In silence that please to the ears and crumbles every now and then.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Everything here rhymes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Like in riddles for children between the bush and the tree.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It is like a third neighbor.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:38.000
She sees variations harvests recognizes mutual secret relationships duties.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Confused beginnings tangled threads.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And in the nooks exceptions.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
She knows what is often dense.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
What bravely separately.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
What's up, hi there in the clouds and close in the gaps.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:16.000
What's the word swarms and the ravine needles foliage.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
What is a maple ash.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
What is a birch.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What is.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Only death speaks here in common pros.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
She knows what's here.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Running stitching, the very edge of the path.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Fly flushed and disappeared.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Although a masterpiece supernatural and sub natural.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
She knows where the Gothic sky is.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And where is the Baroque in the ball

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that here is a Siskin.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
There is a run.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And with the chaffinch. And since felling. The Oaks rearing up,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and then back in a clearing well known to her, but not the one scene in the morning,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and only among people does anger collect her, because everyone is guilty.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Who from others is different.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:04.000

Bergen December 2014 Hello 2021.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Thank you, Tina Scott for that fantastic piece

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
that was titled feminist manifesto and times of coronavirus I should have read the title at the beginning.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Next up, we have used to tie here from Shanghai, you see, are you ready.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Hello everyone.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Welcome to speak pen.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
You've probably wandered around the internet and came across this drawing tool.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I'm you Joe, and today I'm here to guide you through your first creation.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.000
In the following tutorials. I will explore some of the main components contributed to the drawing tool.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Let's get started.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:51.000
writing has always been a huge part of my life.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I write about anything.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
They're not necessarily good, but it's a ritual that I do

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
have written scripts lurks homes fictions and nonfiction means.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I wrote about a movies that I saw keep one that the weather and random words like this.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:30.000
For me, grant writing is a way to de stress.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I remember the first time that I started writing was actually an incident.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:49.000
I had just turned nine or 10. And my parents took me and my best friend camping, to celebrate my birthday.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
We're not really that outdoorsy type or adventurous type.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:04.000
So that was very exciting for me.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Just outside our campsite.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
There was a stream with lots of rocks on it.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And of course, as kids.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Yeah, my friend had to go jump on the rocks.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
There I was

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:46.000
excited to go on my first adventure for the rocks was too slippery.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
And my shoes was wrong.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
So I fell into the water.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:08.000
I remember crying so hard and feeling so embarrassed that our whole family had to pack up and go home.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:18.000
To this day, my friends so made phone with me.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Remembering that afternoon, I can still feel the disappointment in the car ride home,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
remember feeling embarrassed remorseful sad.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
So when I got home, I started writing.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
My dad had kept all my journals from when I was a kid,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
There in his store

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
in a studies.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Couple of years ago I started looking at those journals and realized that I used to draw pictures to replace some of the words that I that I didn't know how to write that was very interesting to me.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I started theorizing about those writings I did back when I was a kid, And I even tried to create those texts,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000
but they just like to play for this, the pureness, and then I Eunice.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:28:01.000
What a shame how when you grow up, you become so preoccupied with making sense of everything.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:29.000
My favorite book was Blitz by Maggie Nelson. Blue Bloods, what's a gift from a friend.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000
This was also her favorite book,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
I remember the first time I picked it up. My friend Rubio was playing.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Van Halen guitar.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And after a couple pages.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:06.000
I felt a kind of closeness to Maggie, to be, and even to Eddie Van Halen

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
days later.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I've decided to translate book into Chinese.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I've asked Ruby would be a reason for someone to like the color blue.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Sure applied

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:46.000
blues, the easiest color to match.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
It's like black, she said.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
It's an absence of color, but a color.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
It's like being expressive.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:08.000
While not appear to be expressive

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
down there inside seen gun show.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Fortunately song portion she signs me. Yes,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
sir. So I'm sure sure that safe enjoy each for

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:40.000
a color blue emerged from the coziness of an atom spirit created when two people are connected emotionally and intellectually and are physically.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:31:01.000
This was the sentence I wrote on the first page of the notebook, where I translated now since bullets.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:12.000
But there are words that cannot be expressed with different languages.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
There are words that are not meant to be translated.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
There are words

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
that are not meant to be translated.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:58.000
There are words that are not meant to be translated.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:17.000
from that I have been using for the past six years.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Was that its maximum capacity.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
I've struggled for the last couple months.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And finally, last week I had to do a hard reset to wipe it storage.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I had a lot of trouble transferring all the data to the cloud around to another device.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
To be perfectly honest, I haven't been writing for a while now.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I worked at a small company from nine to seven.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
A lot of my time and my energy got consumed.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Empty soda cans and dirty laundry started to pile up in my room.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Like the image of a stereotypical programmer.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I hunched over the desk, thinking about the time that I fell into the stream.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:48.000
More as you on this tool, the slower, it becomes.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I think it is also exhausted.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:37.000
It probably wants to go back.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Eric, are you awesome.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:56.000

They don't tell me how you feel about to God, the most important single point you.

During the diving board. It's your uncle on the camera you can gain their, their picture the diner. It was at the end of the trees that concert the CPE redeemable coming on to like Excuse me.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:21.000
What's the typical.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:31.000
The break which reminded everyone not of justice, but events which are the poet's foreshadowing for an unexpected irreversible and Loomis chart.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
They spoke to each other. What shall we take from this.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
What about the bush.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:59.000
What does it matter.

spot, and assurance paper was said to become overinflated that it's calculus the disinherited for spirals, She can be sound desolation, as the satisfaction of channels and backgrounds, as the vapor me runs in miniature which was cultivated and look just

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:42.000
like a diminutive daughter in the manger with Sydney patch the candidate bundling drugs, or they had some name. So the type of sparkling water which was supposed to do something or neutralize effects that the plans

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Did anything for how easily don't get when put into term that number is given the right materials for the right equations.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:03.000
The time for movement, which through an innovation of one of the druids could now be reckoned on one of the agricultural grids was estimated on what he called the comedy type in later humor, you'll note as a color printer ink can be accumulated in more

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:16.000
than one way. This was not possible to do in the tapping later which constitutes maker to abandon the product and engage in the botanical analysis of herbal threads, the classification of the Lucknow tendencies of the trip this criminal.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:29.000
The idea that you could form a consistent stands by leaping off rocks was almost universally disputed yet for the author of the tablet later it was clear that the only evidence of criminality was an active inversion.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:43.000
It was clear that this was not the data undermining most of the critiques that repetitive. That is, it was not through eventful analysis but the reproduction of event which, for all the many parameters to keep constant would consistently create random

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:57.000
variations. The hunch of the performance completely in the solvent, the preservation of pigments and liquid combination with not reverse but the same club then each defense and violence in the idea of the desolation of the now entirely obscured figure

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:27.000
was the case of continuity, the manicure of simmering spiral inflation syndrome, and the comedy tabulate a record in the most wretched of terms reprimanded for a more consistent result.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Thank you. That was beautiful.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:26.000
It was it was a good tour of a cosmic prismatic engine.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Thank you.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
clapping.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Next on our on our list is Jason Nelson, with secret lives of a lockdown objects but unfortunately I think those secret lives may remain secret because I don't think he's here with us Jason Are you here under, under an assumed name, different name.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
I don't think so. So

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:10.000
I'm just hoping that you'll suddenly appear but I don't think so. So next up we will have a dar who just momentarily appeared DARPA trauma and company from St Petersburg, Russia, with freedom is freedom is freedom is freedom.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:18.000
This performances are authored by Daria with participants who are students of the Laboratory of media poetry went to one instructors Berg.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:37.000
And so I read their names, I practice reading and they probably won't be too bad. The other participants are all Sasha, and need a Christian Scalia serial killer, and a totally Pamela master copy over, Leon stroke of the on a picnic over Catarina review

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:52.000
over in an associate trust, and the PErforM participants in this performance also include you member of the audience or fellow performer in this zoom event if you would like to participate Daria will explain how this will work, and we'll have a concluding

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
portion of this piece in tomorrow's performance session.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
So Daria. And thank you, America for introduction.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:17.000
I'm excited to be here. And so I'm really going to invite all of you to take part in performance, right after this meeting.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Well actually, I'm sure you're tired of sitting in front of the screen and want to take a walk and it will be the performance section first combined for the trees, and communication that the telegraph cap.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Give me 30 seconds I will share dreams means to telegram chat with you, this is Chad. Yeah. Okay.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
So now, I'm enjoying it.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:54.000
And so as I mentioned, all the Laboratory of media boys.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:05.000
They also they are in the performance. And I also call this some of you know, take back to Thomas is called freedom is freedom. freedom is freedom.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Very short conceptual poem by service. After several of the classes he reflected on freedom to, to, and when me and students came up with the theme of the performance.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:37.000
We discussed this creation, old. The being a young artist in contemporary rush.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:48.000
internationally can take in jail time, even for a simple report or social medium. So now we as artists mirror our intentions, against the degree of inner freedom.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:55.000
So, it was our officers deflection on the, on the feel of the performance.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I'm looking forward to, to reflections and. Now, let me say a few words about how to go How do you happen to be the moderator. It's actually right in the chat, and predetermine what media should be used to answer the

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.000
old tasks so we will remind you of Inception from conceptual art.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
In fact, I was actually in a sense of the follower.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:51.000
It was the creative freedom and those given condition. So, we will have various tasks and you will have direct major. And so you have very determined condition of I'ma go over this The format is to understand the mechanics of the multimedia like Chad,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Really so tools for the nation, like location noises voice messages, photos and social media file.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Girl part of the leverage full fledged and re capture the participants in communication.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:18.000
So the loss of their us are being formed rapidly right here. Now, before our eyes and our fingers.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:35.000
So my best idea is to research this process process, and I invite you to search for your own logos of artistic communication in chat ties into the platform at the greatest to do.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.000
And please, let me say a few words about performance together, Andrew.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
I will turn on my creativity demonstration.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000
For now you have the pedigree chart.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
I'm so

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:08.000
tired of start right after the finish of this meeting, and it will last about 40 minutes. Yes, but they can bog, as I mentioned before, please turn chat.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:15.000
So, this performance, about the dog for a walk so don't forget to charge your phone right now please.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:33.000
And listen to me. And I will ask you to be the default, and have a son. Next, that's when most of you will answer and if I see that nobody is not typing so if you don't want to answer.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
so feel free. Just be quiet.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:54.000
So, in brackets up to my best career you will see, which means I will ask you to write should be like, ask you answer by voice message or by photo, if I write any soul.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:08.000
You're free to do any media and the also yes I would be grateful to you. If you go right on their response to my performance.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
I hope that I will see some this by, you're in the telegram performance job.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:34.000
You're in the telegram performance job. Yes. Unfortunately I see the question charter So, no, you should have.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Tesla car, but it's very easy just your phone number and the phone has a reputation for example, it looks like to with with telegram that you can use something like Google Voice or another like sort of temporary number to create an account so it wouldn't

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
necessarily have to be your phone number.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:04.000
There are some other options if you're if you'd like to receive that are reluctant to, to use the app with your own number.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Great I had one other question for you, Tommy which is, if, if people are not available right now. If they're available, say, a little later, could they join the chat and how the instructions and do it a little bit later between today and tomorrow.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Is that something that is possible.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000
No, it's just you know at that time.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Everyone, this resistance. Being here and now and corresponding with each other.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
