00:34:10	Jessica Pressman:	Ocean as Media Platform for Electronic Literature: 
The ocean is a media platform. Recognizing it as such can change how we think of platform, media, and meaning. This panel takes an ecocritical approach. We understand the ocean to be a primary platform for life on Earth, encompassing 70% of our globe, and also a platform that inspires much of our digital life and literature. We take Joellyn Rock and Alison Aune’s FISHNETSTOCKINGS” as sinew connecting our diverse our critical methodologies and perspectives, as we consider how emerging knowledge from environmental humanities informs 
electronic literature.

01:27:39	Caitlin Fisher:	i’m trying out the snapchat mermaid filters #research ;)
