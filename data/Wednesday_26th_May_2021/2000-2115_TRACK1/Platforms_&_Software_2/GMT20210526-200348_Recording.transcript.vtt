1
00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.199
hey what we're gonna do and.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.820
Okay.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.090
Jessica Pressman: Well, welcome everyone.

4
00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.010
Mark Marino: Wait wait wait.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.500
Mark Marino: I just thought for a second Patrick you're in the wrong session.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.240
Patrick Lichty: What am I.

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.550
Mark Marino: you're supposed to be in track to right now.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.190
Patrick Lichty: Oh no it's okay I gotta go see you later bye.

9
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.540
Jessica Pressman: There we go.

10
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.940
Mark Marino: it's very confusing the way the.

11
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.300
The you know sorry.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.600
Melody Jue: A different track.

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.010
Jessica Pressman: it's amazing you can just you know log on log off.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.260
Jessica Pressman: Alright, so this track, this is a panel and what we have planned for you today is.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:10.500
Jessica Pressman: For brief talks about 12 minutes each and then time for hopefully time for Q amp a and i'm going to save time by typing the bios into the chat, but I do want to read the brief abstract for the panel, because it does make I think it provides some cohesion for the very different perspectives.

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.760
Jessica Pressman: That you're going to hear today, so if you don't mind me reading.

17
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.230
Jessica Pressman: The the topic of this panel is ocean as media platform for electronic literature and.

18
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.430
Jessica Pressman: And we we argue that the Ocean is a media platform recognizing it as such can change how we think of platform media and meaning.

19
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.450
Jessica Pressman: This panel takes an eco critical approach we understand the ocean, to be a primary platform for life on earth.

20
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:49.920
Jessica Pressman: encompassing 70% of our globe and also a platform that inspires much of our digital life and literature, we take joelle and rock and allison.

21
00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:05.940
Jessica Pressman: I you need that right fishnet stockings as the sun new connecting our diverse critical methodologies and perspectives as we consider how emerging knowledge from environmental humanities informs electronic literature.

22
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:26.640
Jessica Pressman: So you'll you're going to hear for very different talks, but all of us all the speakers are located in southern California near the ocean and i'm going to i'm going to begin with melody do and i'm going to type her bio into the chat and melody do you have a sharing access.

23
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.440
Melody Jue: Yes.

24
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.360
Jessica Pressman: Okay awesome take it away.

25
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.560
Melody Jue: Okay, great so let me go ahead and share screen.

26
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:50.790
Melody Jue: And here we go Okay, so I come to this this panel is scholar in media studies, but also the ocean humanities, and I just wrote a book called wild blue media thinking through seawater.

27
00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:03.900
Melody Jue: That imagines what happens when you submerge familiar terms and media in the ocean, how do they change, how did they deform what do oceanic conditions do as an environment to the way that we think about.

28
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:13.140
Melody Jue: terms in media studies so for today, I thought I would submerge the term platform and see where that takes us so platform.

29
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:26.730
Melody Jue: In platform studies is an architectural metaphor it's the odd describes it as a surface or area on which something may stand, especially a raised level surface.

30
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:40.710
Melody Jue: Secondary definitions also describe it as which is familiar for us in southern California, a base for marine oil or gas drilling raised on piles above the level of the sea and also or oil rig.

31
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:57.390
Melody Jue: or alternately a high rigid diving board, so you know you think about in the Olympics platform diving is also like is raised above the water, so what all three of these have in common, are a kind of plane or surface that float that.

32
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:08.790
Melody Jue: is raised above the water in some kind of way, rather than being within the water, so I was thinking about these in relation to these these meetings in relation to.

33
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:19.110
Melody Jue: Other environmental media studies questions we could ask about platforms so, for example, what elements of the Environment underlie the possibility of.

34
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:28.830
Melody Jue: computational platforms so lots of work and environmental media studies around the way that energy often non renewable energy sustains the platform.

35
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.370
Melody Jue: infrastructures for energy rare earth metals.

36
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:45.120
Melody Jue: air conditioning for servers and also conditions that exclude certain elements of the environment so dust or spilled coffee, these would be things destructive to the possibility of a computational platform.

37
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:59.070
Melody Jue: Also, just to acknowledge my own position ality in Santa Barbara, this is a map of where oil oil wells currently exist on the coast, so I can't I can't think platform without immediately.

38
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:12.000
Melody Jue: Recognizing the view that I see whenever I go to the ocean, which is all these platforms dotted along the coast, and so you can see here, even a small note.

39
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:24.210
Melody Jue: let's see from referred to beach if you see this, there was an oil spill here from one of the oil rigs that happens, the same year I got hired at ucsb and so it's it's something that.

40
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:35.100
Melody Jue: You know, we think about a lot here Okay, and also, you know, but the oil rig is complex, as a platform, because it actually has a volumetric.

41
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:47.370
Melody Jue: underbelly, meaning that the platform itself is poised above the water, but if you look at this visual visualization here the platform, the lies, all these kinds of.

42
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.720
Melody Jue: Well wells that extend out into space across three dimensions.

43
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:04.020
Melody Jue: And so, this was bringing to mind the recent collection from Duke press called volumetric states sovereignty materiality and the territorial imagination.

44
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:17.460
Melody Jue: edited by frank delay that examines some of the stakes for political theory area studies and elemental media studies for really thinking about volumes.

45
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:39.630
Melody Jue: In contrast to surfaces and, in particular one chapter, I really appreciated was by iowa on on the buoyancy of the nation state so just to read a few quotes from here the buoyancy of the nation state describes how the zonal manipulation of land, sea air interfaces can boy sovereign power.

46
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:49.650
Melody Jue: Thinking about the nation state in the ocean means also considering the 200 mile exclusive economic zone or easy, as that is.

47
00:06:50.820 --> 00:07:01.800
Melody Jue: The the territory that a nation can claim for fishing exclusive fishing rights and on it goes on further to think about Singapore as a case study.

48
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.560
Melody Jue: And says the following both by claiming the water sunlight and the rock from the ocean surface under its jurisdiction and.

49
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:24.210
Melody Jue: that's a typo there, but by physically carving and undersea demi monde of storage tunnels, the three dimensional sovereignty in Singapore bolsters its buoyancy and preparation for a peerless near future.

50
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:36.360
Melody Jue: So to pull back a little bit there's a broader question about metaphor here, so you can think about the way that with the metaphor of standing, which is inherent to the term platform.

51
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:50.520
Melody Jue: With a metaphor of standing you think about standing on a solid surface and security in that formulation is takes a terrestrial form so security means the land stays put you have solid ground under your feet.

52
00:07:51.090 --> 00:08:01.560
Melody Jue: This other conception of security comes from buoyancy so in iowa ons formulation it's this ability to float through rough or turbulent sees.

53
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:12.600
Melody Jue: So I wanted to think through today about the contrast between platform in relation to standing versus platform in relation to buoyancy or the way that the ocean.

54
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:21.150
Melody Jue: As platform or the ocean as milenio provides a different meditation on or different metaphor material metaphor.

55
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:31.290
Melody Jue: Through thinking about buoyancy so i'm curious about buoyancy and it's epistemic positions and implications, I realized I forgot to set a timer so.

56
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.750
Melody Jue: JESSICA mark if you want to flag me if i'm you know running late just go ahead and give me a heads up.

57
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.230
Melody Jue: Now, one reason that the question of buoyancy matters in electronic media, including games.

58
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:51.900
Melody Jue: Is that is concerns the question of what aspects of water or emulated when one transitions to additional medium so.

59
00:08:52.260 --> 00:09:00.030
Melody Jue: A close colleague of mine alaina Chang has a new book out called play nature, and this is her description of game aesthetics.

60
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:07.440
Melody Jue: She says, we can see the particular realization of an environment, whether textual visual or procedural as a filter.

61
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:23.400
Melody Jue: That helpfully select certain aspects for consideration, while excluding others so game environments are always very particular about what they emulate and then constitute into the mechanics of an environment so for me I write about this in the third chapter of my book.

62
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.610
Melody Jue: What elements of sea water or imagined in digital media what aspects of seawater.

63
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:39.990
Melody Jue: are excluded, and so I think a lot about how increase station or the vivacious qualities of sea water to grow or to erode or to otherwise.

64
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:50.970
Melody Jue: form and deform often are ignored in game environments, which tend to think about the clarity and also model, the clarity of water, compared with the opacity of water.

65
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.940
Melody Jue: Treating it like a like air or almost outer space is something you can you can move through.

66
00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:09.660
Melody Jue: So as an example of thinking through buoyancy and the platform, I wanted to talk today about beyond blue, which is a game developed by eli media and also the BBC and ocean X.

67
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:20.580
Melody Jue: And this game is part of a broader campaign for ocean education but it takes platform in a couple different ways we can think about mobility in the game.

68
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:30.870
Melody Jue: In relation to buoyancy and that which supports the body, as opposed to standing, so the way the character floats but also think about the.

69
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:38.070
Melody Jue: ocean advocacy and beyond blue, as also taking on a kind of political platform to draw attention to things like deep sea mining.

70
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:46.290
Melody Jue: So this is a view of the underwater home that the protagonists to play MRI who's actually.

71
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:53.940
Melody Jue: physically and personality wise modeled after a friend of mine who's a deep sea scientists in Georgia, and she.

72
00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:04.200
Melody Jue: associate this is her home basis is the place where she has standing and, as you can see here she's gazing out at some sperm whales that she family that she's been tracking and studying.

73
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:14.250
Melody Jue: But the game actually does a very good job of I think treating the ocean as an opaque medium, a lot of the scenes are at night.

74
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:24.840
Melody Jue: And some of the strategies for navigation have to do with sonar so as you're floating in the water column, you also use sonar to locate where interesting.

75
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:40.020
Melody Jue: or organisms of interest may be, and then you swim to them without seeing what exactly they are until you're close enough and so here, where I have some over to the sperm whales who sleep, while they're floating in this direction.

76
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:51.810
Melody Jue: You can also hear recording sounds and so and scan the different whales like for fluke tail signatures and so these are some of the different.

77
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:59.790
Melody Jue: game mechanics also mariah has like probably the strongest ABS, I know in in game, because you know you're swimming along with a dolphin kick and i'm just going yeah that's.

78
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.590
Melody Jue: That was a you know significant choice on you know the part of the designers.

79
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:12.060
Melody Jue: So rather than a submersible she's physically swimming and boyd by the water as she's moving throughout the ocean, including the deep ocean.

80
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:23.910
Melody Jue: Now one interesting place to think about surfaces versus volumes is also this seeing here, where she visits an underwater Brian pool, which is essentially an underwater lake of hyper singing water.

81
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:34.950
Melody Jue: And the BBC has documentary footage that mandy joy, my friend has taken of this location, but in the game and also is dramatize as this place to collect.

82
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:52.440
Melody Jue: Bacteria so there's I should also mention that mariah live streams all of her dives and so there's a very public aspect to the way that she is boyd by water at the same time that she uses that as a platform for drawing attention to ocean ocean issues.

83
00:12:53.970 --> 00:13:03.390
Melody Jue: Okay, so i'm just going to skip over this line go further, the last screenshot I want to show is of these drill bits that mariah encounters at the end of the game.

84
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:19.590
Melody Jue: Which ends is fairly open ended we don't know what she's doing after this, but where our attention is drawn to to regimes of extraction, including for deep sea for deep sea minerals.

85
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:27.390
Melody Jue: And then finally finally Here we see her gazing at hydrothermal vents.

86
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:44.430
Melody Jue: Okay, so following I will on, I want to ask a question about how buoyancy configure to really be used to describe conditions that support continued life so platform versus is you know would be support by standing, but the water also supports and.

87
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.540
Melody Jue: How the metaphor of buoyancy can also think about how we navigate turbulence conditions or waters.

88
00:13:52.140 --> 00:14:03.270
Melody Jue: In this way, we might call beyond blue and amphibious game for the way that it negotiates both buoyancy and standing to advocate for non extractive relationships to the ocean.

89
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:09.810
Melody Jue: I just want to conclude with a couple mentions of fishnet stockings which will lead into marks presentation nicely.

90
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:27.330
Melody Jue: And just asked about how how are buoyancy and standing operating as aesthetics and physical positions in the piece, and how might we think about gravity, so I think about gravity literacy and orientation is key parts of an ocean communities kind of project.

91
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:39.450
Melody Jue: and not to be okay, this is this is meant seriously, and you know not to you know take away from the piece, but I was struck by the way, that some of the footage of the making a fishnet stockings also.

92
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:47.280
Melody Jue: involves standing and the function of the pivot which recall the scene from little mermaid about the time that the.

93
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:57.330
Melody Jue: The more people are turned into these worms bye bye Ursula and so actually wonder if being turned into a worm is.

94
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:06.540
Melody Jue: Connected to a kind of human terrestrial experience of gravity, that means being fixed in place in order for a movement, unlike the mermaids normal freedom within space.

95
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:18.660
Melody Jue: So I feel like there's maybe something here but i'll ask that, as a question and then, finally, I just wanted to also offer the question for fishnet stockings, how do you how might we conceive of buoyancy in relation to.

96
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:36.960
Melody Jue: text and the movement of the elements of the collage across space, and I think mark will have more to say on this question relating to flocking and the animation of things like jellyfish Okay, I hope I didn't go too much over Thank you.

97
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.210
Jessica Pressman: so wonderful.

98
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.950
Jessica Pressman: Thank you.

99
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.210
Jessica Pressman: Well let's go to mark mark Marino here's his bio let's let's hear it mark.

100
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.240
Jessica Pressman: you're muted.

101
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.130
Jessica Pressman: I know you've done this for like a year and a half.

102
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.660
Jessica Pressman: i'm going to type in the abstract, to the conference.

103
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.770
Mark Marino: One sorry there we go, so can you hear me now, as they say they say.

104
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.190
Mark Marino: Okay let's get started, thank you JESSICA, and thank you.

105
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:24.180
Mark Marino: panelists and they're all you folks for joining us, and those are watching the video later on hope you're enjoying it hope there's a.

106
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:39.960
Mark Marino: wonderful day you're enjoying okay let's get started, so this code diving into the code of immersive he lit, and this is going to be critical code studies reading of joelle and rocks and allison on Nice.

107
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:49.860
Mark Marino: fishnet stockings so a little bit of context for so first when I was originally thinking about this piece, I wanted to put into some context so.

108
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:56.550
Mark Marino: I don't have a slide for this one, but there are a couple of vr pieces by shar Davies that I think are really important to consider.

109
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:07.110
Mark Marino: In this context, but first let's a way to think about Camille otter back in and Rami adjectives text rain, I think a lot of you guys have experienced this one or seen it where we were catching.

110
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:17.940
Mark Marino: letters in our hands right people, those people are standing in front of the scene and then their projections are catching those letters I also want to think about this piece.

111
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:28.710
Mark Marino: By stephanie stricklin and Nick monfort see and Spar between, which is a piece that uses combines a poetry generator and a.

112
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:46.770
Mark Marino: navigational metaphor of traversing an ocean of generated tex so and I want to think about this concept of immersive nervous as well, so, first let me just play a little video of this piece, this is from joanne's documentation that you can find on the website for this page.

113
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:55.470
Mark Marino: So fishnet stockings was featured in Bergen at elo.

114
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:04.980
Mark Marino: And also is featured in our House, interestingly, in March 2016, so this is a piece that fits well into this Community.

115
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:18.090
Mark Marino: It was a collaboration between joelle and rock Logan sales Peter Williamson and allison Ani and a crew of collaborators and took some inspiration by artist Kathy mactavish.

116
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:25.380
Mark Marino: If you watch closely you'll see me and my kids when they were smaller in this video documentation.

117
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:33.150
Mark Marino: I should mention that the system could see some of my family members, better than others.

118
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:46.080
Mark Marino: and full disclosure, I contributed some of the some tweets to various stages of this project, I have to apologize if i'm shouting right now, because i'm not sharing sound of this piece, but I am hearing it in my ears so.

119
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.460
Mark Marino: Some point i'll someday i'll learn how to vimeo.

120
00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:04.830
Mark Marino: The speed is pieces of made up of three x act one is called innocence in curiosity it features flocking mermaids fish and jellies that follow the user that.

121
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:15.510
Mark Marino: Either chase one user or another, depending on on the piece, so you can see here how they're sort of moving towards the hands is there detected through a Microsoft kinect.

122
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:24.570
Mark Marino: i'm gonna let that play for just a little tiny bit so you get a sense there's there's me and i'm being chased by jellyfish.

123
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.560
Mark Marino: Okay, and then maybe I could skip ahead to show you a little bit of Act two.

124
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.110
Mark Marino: which happens, a little bit further on in the video got some dancers.

125
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:52.710
Mark Marino: Here we go back to stormy sea shipwreck and rescue involves that act that we just saw a second ago of these people trying to catch a ship in a net.

126
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:58.980
Mark Marino: So they both are holding essentially holding the corners of that ship and they're drawing up that net around the ship.

127
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:12.840
Mark Marino: And lastly, act three, which involves creating these sort of circles of fish and then slicing them apart, essentially, so this is my daughter she's creating this she's doing a slicing motion to create.

128
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.570
Mark Marino: That set of fish and then she's going to slice them apart it's going to take a little while.

129
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:30.030
Mark Marino: to register and there they go she cut him apart again that third act is called bad bargains and good exchange rates So these are all plays on the popular.

130
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:38.640
Mark Marino: Hans Christian Andersen tale of the little mermaid and various other mermaids that we have in our culture, so it's not just drawing from there.

131
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:54.360
Mark Marino: I was most interested in the code used to model how the jellyfish mermaids and monsters as they're called move, and that that code is called flocking and.

132
00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:14.700
Mark Marino: Flooding is a variation of of code used to model, the flocking patterns of birds there's a version in processing written by Daniel shifman but it's inspired by this work by Craig Reynolds a program called boyd's in 1986 an artificial life program so.

133
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:16.410
Mark Marino: and

134
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:26.640
Mark Marino: I love that that name boyd's because my father used to quote this little poem that referred to birds as boys, but I suspect that this is the the.

135
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:39.000
Mark Marino: influence on this code, because in the code, the murder folk are referred to as murder boys and also the flocking code also deals with steel steering mechanisms for other boyd's.

136
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:46.620
Mark Marino: So a couple of their attributes they follow the user, sometimes user one Sometimes these are two they avoid contact with each user.

137
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.290
Mark Marino: there's some randomness in their movement, the randomness makes me wonder if there's I don't know if their schooling.

138
00:21:52.620 --> 00:22:04.650
Mark Marino: Or if they're showing we haven't talked about that different distinction just yet schooling if they're going so if the group of fish is going somewhere together or showing as i've seen it to find if they're staying together, for social reasons.

139
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:15.810
Mark Marino: So I just want to share a little bit more about this flocking algorithm because it's it's fairly well known and fairly well us and it has been adapted deficient other contexts by other people.

140
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:24.060
Mark Marino: So we've got this flocking behavior and it's got several attributes one of them is cohesion we want to keep that group together.

141
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:37.110
Mark Marino: One of them is separation, so my daughter who's taking a marine biology classes taught me that fish can tell, through the pressure sensors and the sides of their bodies how close they are their proximity to other fish, so that they can swim together without hitting each other.

142
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:52.950
Mark Marino: there's alignment and there's obstacle avoidance So those are the various features and we can later on in the video they kind of move on to the so alignment and obstacle, avoiding or the other features of this flocking algorithm.

143
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:09.000
Mark Marino: So this is the the mermaid code inspired by algorithms used to model, the behavior of birds, and then they do one of two things they either follow one user or another or their idol.

144
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:21.060
Mark Marino: And I don't have time to talk about this code, right now, but in depth the way I would love to but here's some of it and, by the way this piece is written in processing and Java so there's combination of files being used here.

145
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:39.390
Mark Marino: Now, also of course here's where we see the code keeps the boyd's and again this gets applied to the jellyfish the mermaids the fish, and also the monsters as they're called in the code, it keeps the the birds from one another, from from hitting each other from colliding with each other.

146
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:48.330
Mark Marino: And then also we have some code that deals with keeping them away from the users, so they won't they shouldn't run into the users when they can detect where the user is.

147
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:57.540
Mark Marino: And then I just want to point out a couple of there are a couple of adjustments that are made this is perhaps where the buoyancy lies in the code Melanie.

148
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:05.220
Mark Marino: When they're in their idol position their position is readjusted a bit, and so we see that if you watch the video you see that they.

149
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:18.960
Mark Marino: They almost move in almost like a circular pattern, or they seem to like bounce back a little bit from wherever they are various points, and some of that is happening in this movement where they're being an idle state being adjusted their positions being adjusted a bit.

150
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.030
Mark Marino: All of this code looking through this code has made me think about hybridization and.

151
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:39.150
Mark Marino: In done a highway cyborg manifesto she's got this great quote, we were all cameras theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism, in short, we are cyborgs.

152
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:50.760
Mark Marino: And so that's that made me think about all the hybridization that's happening in this code and in this piece right so mermaids from their beginning are hybrids right there people and fish.

153
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:57.570
Mark Marino: there's this great thing that I did not see when I first looked at it until I saw its name in the code and in the files.

154
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:09.120
Mark Marino: The ship mermaid and, if you look, you can see that mermaid at the head of the ship, but then, once you know it's called the ship mermaid you can see the tail and you could see how this is a hybrid mermaid and ship.

155
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:20.940
Mark Marino: Of course, the mermaids being merged boys is another hybrid that shows up in the Code and the jellyfish also are referred to as boyd, so there are also a kind of mash up or hybrid that comes out of this piece.

156
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.810
Mark Marino: So this piece immerses you and in various ways.

157
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.800
Mark Marino: One thing I haven't talked about, is it includes a Twitter stream or people use hashtags to contribute lines to the story.

158
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:50.730
Mark Marino: So that immerses your text in the piece you place your body between the projector and screen and are immersed in that sense, and this darkened room and then the system read your body into the screen to get your coordinates and so you're immersed in a digital sense as well.

159
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:58.530
Mark Marino: But a lot of this happens, two dimensionally so the fish, jellies and mermaids are they operate in two dimensions.

160
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:09.240
Mark Marino: The users are also in two dimensions and the one place where the Z factor, the Z coordinate comes into play is in that act to when they're moving the ship.

161
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:15.330
Mark Marino: And i'll show you how that works in a second right here so see this picture the person on your right is.

162
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:28.260
Mark Marino: is holding up the net but they're so they're sort of pulling it towards them, so you see the nets, a little bit bigger towards them, then the person on the left, where the Z index is a little closer to the screen and so you can see how the Code has adjusted.

163
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:40.500
Mark Marino: The visual to give it that sense of three dimensions so that's really where things get a three dimensional feel otherwise things both the fish and us get get brought into the same two dimensional world.

164
00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:53.160
Mark Marino: i'm not all are immersed in the same way that connect, as it turns out, has difficulty seeing black skin You might remember my reference to my family members.

165
00:26:53.970 --> 00:27:09.180
Mark Marino: There was a game spot study where they tested it out and they found out the system recognized one employee consistently well, it was never able to properly identify the other, despite repeated calibration attempts, however connect had no parties identifying.

166
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.350
Mark Marino: Another one after some some calibration.

167
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.320
Mark Marino: Light skinned employees were also consistently picked up on the first try.

168
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:30.630
Mark Marino: So now here i'm thinking about the work of there was mentioned in our keynote of coated bias, the the film if you've seen a job wall and when he's worked justify a noble's work we have benjamin's work.

169
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:39.060
Mark Marino: And I think it's right to call that with the CONNECT is doing a form of systematic racism in in the computational sense.

170
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:53.670
Mark Marino: But joelle and rock and allison Ani are already meditating on blackness and whiteness and so shall Diana in a talk that comes after this one so that's all i'm gonna say, for now, but thank you guys for listening.

171
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:57.960
Jessica Pressman: awesome mark.

172
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.100
Jessica Pressman: Thanks so much.

173
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:07.710
Jessica Pressman: And next we have my colleague and friend Diana Leon going to type her bio into the chat and go ahead, Diana.

174
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:20.820
Diana Leong: Hello everybody, thank you for joining us today I apologize I think my talk is my run them a little bit over I actually.

175
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:33.630
Diana Leong: was really careful and make sure I was going to be in timeline but then I made the mistake of watching the nori last night and I felt bad about myself like you have to be a better have your family go about your paper so it's a little bit longer now.

176
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:44.850
Diana Leong: Okay, so in July of 2020 is the words racist fish were spray printed across the base of Copenhagen spain's little memory statute.

177
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:52.080
Diana Leong: appearing as it did, against the backdrop of global anti racist protests this accusation seems to implicate anderson's fairy tale or the country of Denmark.

178
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.190
Diana Leong: In the same systems of anti blackness that were responsible for the murder of George floyd.

179
00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:07.170
Diana Leong: Well done mark was the first European country to abolish the slave trade in each or three slavery actually get to meet in the Danish question these until 1848 or 11 years after the initial publication benefits very tough.

180
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:17.220
Diana Leong: Anderson scholars have established the many ways this context influenced his body of work, but their general consensus seems to be that race and anti blackness, in particular, it was not a central concern.

181
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:27.630
Diana Leong: As Andrew swanson of the University of Southern Denmark commented in reference to the July incident quote I am having a hard time seeing what is particularly racist in fairy tale little mermaid Unquote.

182
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:37.140
Diana Leong: Just as a sidebar I don't know it's just me, but when I saw the little mermaid as a little kid I also had the same the same flop, but once I started.

183
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:46.020
Diana Leong: My studies in black studies, I came to the realization that Ursula is just an angry black woman with threats, so I don't know i'm the only one who's.

184
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.540
Diana Leong: going to take.

185
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.910
Diana Leong: before becoming the model of white whimsical femininity popularized by visiting the remember it was already in your universal figure of folklore.

186
00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:05.100
Diana Leong: Depending on their cultural and historical origins, the mermaids are variously portrayed as vegetable benevolence monstrous or sacred deviant or idealized.

187
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:18.060
Diana Leong: mermaid lower also received a significant boost during the periods of trans Atlantic slavery and the Colombian exchange during which anxieties over novel forms of difference remapped through and onto the mermaids half human half fish form.

188
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:29.910
Diana Leong: Perhaps the most famous example concerns PT Barnum Fiji my right a specimen exhibit in New York Boston 1840s and was lit review to be the head of course will have a monkey so into the fish sondra fish.

189
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:37.410
Diana Leong: It was actually because of a nut despite the controversies around its authenticity, that the Fiji mermaid generated significant public interest.

190
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:46.800
Diana Leong: them, are we not only stood in for the unresolved contradictions between universal on particular characteristics of difference, like those that adhere between racial black men and black bodies.

191
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:55.560
Diana Leong: But also quoted bore out emerging scientific narratives that underserved racial others gender deviance and disabled individuals to be the missing links of evolution.

192
00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:07.830
Diana Leong: And it's not coincidental by columbus's first mention of mermaids comes from a journal entry from a trip recorded or journalists recorded rather didn't voyage to Haiti and eating 43.

193
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:21.780
Diana Leong: nope 1493 1843 way to eat, while this brief account gives us a sense of the mermaids historical economy of representation it doesn't quite address why the mermaid has remained a figure provocation within the afterlife of slavery.

194
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:32.340
Diana Leong: So I will explore today how do all in rock and allison unease 2015 installation fishnet stockings provides us with one way to answer this question.

195
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:40.770
Diana Leong: So i'm going to give you are often used sort of tentative and introductory notes and how electronic literature and oceanic you live in particular.

196
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:48.870
Diana Leong: and places to reconsider the description of race, as a floating signifier or to borrow a term from kills a signifier the boat floats and flickers.

197
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:58.110
Diana Leong: I proposed a fishnet stockings stages, the oceanic entanglements between depth and immersion i'm sorry definite surface as a compliment to the universal in particular.

198
00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:06.630
Diana Leong: And by mapping these entanglements onto the mermaids multiple forms of hybridity or little banality as mark mentioned the mermaid emerges as a simple operational finishes.

199
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:13.830
Diana Leong: So inefficient stockings anderson's fairy tale is recast as a space of invention and intervention.

200
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:25.530
Diana Leong: What makes it particularly useful for me today is its innovative use of silhouettes because the CONNECT tracks and response to audience movements participants are not only able to interact with the sea creatures that so to the narrative.

201
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:33.450
Diana Leong: but also to cast their own shadows on pre recorded videos of dancers, and mermaid silhouettes as they step between the video screen and it's light sources.

202
00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:41.550
Diana Leong: Consequently, the participants and their shadows in perfectly double both Silhouette and dancer later, of whom are also depicted in Silhouette.

203
00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:51.570
Diana Leong: Within this Nice and a beam of shadows Silhouette and material body each and habits, simultaneously, the role of screen and projection positive and negative image and texts and technology.

204
00:32:52.170 --> 00:33:01.020
Diana Leong: The narrative components of venison spiritual or less with fresh to what hell hills called double vision that looks simultaneously at the power of simulation and the materiality is that produces.

205
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:13.440
Diana Leong: We take our Q again from hills, we can say that, like other works feel it fishnet stockings allows us participants to experience flickering significations not only or simply as an actor structure, but as an immersive environments.

206
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:22.260
Diana Leong: At the same time, however, returning a material body to the Silhouette of the mermaid of material or virtual body to the Silhouette of a mermaid.

207
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:32.850
Diana Leong: enables the mermaid to occupy the order of science and scope and lexical and which is signifier marks the absence of its unified and iconic images signifier preserves some measure of its invited.

208
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:40.320
Diana Leong: This this ambivalence in my capacity that I suggest reveals health a mermaid Silhouette and historical dynamics of racial fetishes converged.

209
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:47.070
Diana Leong: So apologies i'm gonna give you a brief overview of racial fetishism from within black studies it's might be.

210
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.330
Diana Leong: familiar to all, but it was really helpful for me to rick to write it out, because I don't know if anyone does psychoanalysis It makes you feel crazy so.

211
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.350
Diana Leong: i'm reading it out loud helps ensure that i'm hopefully i'm not crazy so.

212
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:08.550
Diana Leong: For black studies color David mariette fetishism establishes a perverse relationship difference, by adopting the stereotype as a Defense against more intolerable forms of variety.

213
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:16.560
Diana Leong: while allowing subjects to enjoy their fear of this anxiety in a more or less secret or violent manner, paradoxically, because the object of this anxiety.

214
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:25.140
Diana Leong: is formed out of the search hub itself, it is in fact standing in for a fear of disintegration that is caused by our shape or recognition of the other within us.

215
00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:35.820
Diana Leong: To put this differently, we always already inhabit fetishize relationship to ourselves and to defend against this realization and from the ontological anxieties it conditions.

216
00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:42.840
Diana Leong: The stereotype as fetish allows us to act as if the source of that anxiety originates from somewhere other than our own perceived lack.

217
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:52.080
Diana Leong: More importantly, because the stereotype realizing them all difference that is at once externally externally fixed i'm sorry in eternally fix an endlessly beautiful.

218
00:34:52.470 --> 00:35:04.410
Diana Leong: The enjoyment it imparts derives from the force of this ambivalence rather than destabilizing races spot these seemingly contradictory or ambiguous signifiers or the very means through which racism is enjoyed.

219
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:12.840
Diana Leong: So what does this mean for health, the green screen fire well there has been some efforts to reconcile the tented cycle analysis with hales post-feminist theory.

220
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:21.810
Diana Leong: There has, unfortunately, been very little in regards to race in which fetishism so i'm going to offer a broad sketch of I hope the scholarship might go and then return to it again and conclusion.

221
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:32.040
Diana Leong: For hills or cons signifying economy is based on an analog definition language in which the signifier floats and the network of differentially producing fights.

222
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:43.980
Diana Leong: However, because information technologies operate through dialectical pattern around in this rather than presence and absence, the signifier is indeed link to us and applied, although as material informational entity, rather than seeing itself.

223
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:52.260
Diana Leong: When we consider the flickering signifier alongside of racial fetishism However, it is not entirely clear that race is no longer a signifier that floats.

224
00:35:52.950 --> 00:36:05.160
Diana Leong: were specifically the necessarily ambivalent character of the stereotype suggests that the signifying systems of race, remain grounded patterns presence and absence, a point that receives considerable support from the history of stuff the Silhouette.

225
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:18.060
Diana Leong: oops okay from July, which words abolitionists medallions the broadsides of the book slave ship the Silhouette has occupied a singular role within the iconography slavery and afterlife.

226
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:25.050
Diana Leong: Why, we should not reduce this little bit special history as a style of illustration, and inspect inescapably bounced the stereotype.

227
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:31.020
Diana Leong: This isn't no spark small part is the role of the Silhouette played in the racial pseudo sciences of busy on on me.

228
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:46.650
Diana Leong: Which is harper to say I just say 16 more times Okay, because physiognomy presumes a correspondence between physical features and moral on intellectual characteristics it's practitioner stops to produce models of the body that minimize individual variations.

229
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:56.760
Diana Leong: Their goal was to render visible only those characteristics that we're indicative of a more general type or trend underscore the Silhouette would prove an ideal platform.

230
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:04.680
Diana Leong: The father of modern is you know meet Johan casper laboratory right, for example, that silhouettes alone have extended Mike says, you know acknowledge.

231
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:12.120
Diana Leong: More than any kind of portrait and scenic neither motion know leitner color know rising know cavity this a little bit of recipe tension by fixing it.

232
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:25.800
Diana Leong: On the exterior countries alone it simplifies the observation which by that becomes more easy and accurate the Silhouette as a positive and incontestable proof of the reality of the science is you know mix, thankfully, he was not correct.

233
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:34.320
Diana Leong: For love to resolving the tensions between the universal and a particular characteristics of race, actually required the evacuation if it's more obvious science.

234
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:40.950
Diana Leong: Well, this might seem counterintuitive the Silhouette provided is you know mess, with the abstract symbol on to which they could project project.

235
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:48.030
Diana Leong: Rather than observe and imagine relationship between the bodies extra features it's signifiers and the subjects internal essence signifies.

236
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:56.130
Diana Leong: The Silhouette in this regard realize the operations vibration fetishism to what Sarah light all the disparate there's an analog racial practice.

237
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:06.000
Diana Leong: in which the perception of blackness as a sign of race, relies on the visual continuity of color inscribed in the body surface as a multi which to read or processing information grace.

238
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.030
Diana Leong: Something very similar happens in the contemporary work of artists Kara Walker.

239
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:18.600
Diana Leong: offers cut paper installations explore the social realities of slavery, by placing their silhouettes and so variety of.

240
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:25.890
Diana Leong: scandalized thing moral and sexually compromising positions these figures, which includes slaves and slave masters of like art.

241
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:37.620
Diana Leong: And this is just a shortlist deprecating urinating giving and receiving fellatio flying having sex giving birth and killing and always in ways that unapologetic unapologetically reference blacks are.

242
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:48.090
Diana Leong: Given the obvious salacious nature of these installations Walker has received heavy criticism from other black artists will argue that her work amounts to a little more than minstrelsy.

243
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:56.490
Diana Leong: reproductions niggers negative stereotypes, they claim impedes racial progress by validating the anti black sentiments that white viewers already hold.

244
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:02.010
Diana Leong: But as Walker herself explains the civil rights, act as a blank space that you can project your desires into.

245
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:11.520
Diana Leong: It can be positive or negative it's just a whole and a piece of paper and it's the inside of that whole accounts, the audience has to deal with their own prejudices or fears for desires and they look at these images.

246
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:19.470
Diana Leong: Here walker's emphasis on the audience's interpretive Labor resonates Bob is argument that the stereotype is at once the substitute and shadow.

247
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:25.530
Diana Leong: By exceeding to the wildest fantasies of colonizer the stereotype other reveal something of benefit of that mastery.

248
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:36.900
Diana Leong: As it happens, with physiognomy Walker silhouettes are transformed into stereotypes, to be at the fetishistic projections of viewers i'll be in in such a way that the view must confront the participation in this process.

249
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:43.200
Diana Leong: So, by way of a very simple brock's conclusion, I want to return to the mermaids a little bits of fishnet stockings.

250
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:53.100
Diana Leong: part of what makes this piece so appropriate for my topic, I think, is that the audience members movements and bodies are not simply are only projected onto or juxtaposed against silhouettes.

251
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.470
Diana Leong: Whether it's immersive environment for just examine what happens when we read external identifying markers.

252
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.900
Diana Leong: Like brace, amongst others, not as information itself, but as the result of information processing.

253
00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:18.270
Diana Leong: If, as I was and Durango offers racial blackness is always susceptible to being a signifier of death of death of depth as well as of surface of somebody the fishnet stockings expands that depth to include the multiplicity of somebodies.

254
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:25.560
Diana Leong: And I end with this thought by apple Canadian poet embracing Philip who asks about the slaves last little passage.

255
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:37.590
Diana Leong: What is the word for bringing this back in the water from a liquid grave months later, I do an Internet search for a word or phrase for bringing someone back from underwater that has a precise as meaning, as the unearthing contained within the word soon.

256
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:47.370
Diana Leong: I find words like resurrect and sub aquatic but not X apo this is me that, unlike being entered once you're underwater there's no retrieval which you can never be exempt from water.

257
00:40:48.840 --> 00:41:02.340
Diana Leong: And they'd like to close by posing that as the mermaid hasn't deep and rendered embraces fish in the afterlife slavery, the one way to recover its transgressive possibilities is to recognize the mermaid as a representation of those slaves.

258
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.610
Diana Leong: yay and it didn't make it up.

259
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:06.270
earlier.

260
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.420
Jessica Pressman: And time.

261
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.930
Thank you.

262
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:22.860
Jessica Pressman: My hands tired from taking notes from you guys i'm fantastic Thank you Diana, and thank you for the segue into my talk on mermaids here's my little bio and.

263
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.200
Jessica Pressman: me share screen.

264
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.110
Jessica Pressman: Okay.

265
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:46.230
Jessica Pressman: So I hope you can see okay right, you can see the screen alright So hopefully we have shown you how the Ocean is important part of history and symbolism of electronic literature.

266
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:57.360
Jessica Pressman: But it's also an important part of the history and symbolism of of of our field, as some of my favorite hypertext from the 90s demonstrate.

267
00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:09.360
Jessica Pressman: What I want to do today is is show some very new ideas, not even classifiable his work, but i'm seeking the convergence between my love of he lit and the ocean specifically mermaids.

268
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:23.190
Jessica Pressman: So my caveat is that I won't have time to do more than just provide provocations, but I do plan to be working on this for a while, so if you have ideas or suggestions I very much welcome them So here we go.

269
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:31.860
Jessica Pressman: mermaids are part of the archive of nearly every seafaring culture, and they are an important part of literary history more broadly.

270
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:42.630
Jessica Pressman: My claim is that mermaids are poetic symbols and formal devices that signal transformations in media and media platforms and especially in the media of storytelling.

271
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:52.920
Jessica Pressman: When mermaids emerge they signifies significant changes in the materiality of literary production and reception whether that's oral print digital or all in between.

272
00:42:53.310 --> 00:43:03.360
Jessica Pressman: And they illuminate and this offer opportunities to examine the twinned fears and desires and I think you saw that twinning of fear and desire in the past, talk, especially.

273
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:12.780
Jessica Pressman: that accompany changes and cultural and literary experience it does make sense that they are of important to electronic literature and its history.

274
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:23.610
Jessica Pressman: quote the mermaid stories do not emerge as fairy tales that is as fictions but as myths and legends and quote, and this is from the penguin book of mermaids.

275
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:30.870
Jessica Pressman: And that's important because it means that mermaids a part of history and science as Diana was just suggesting and part, with the focus on Silhouette.

276
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:41.460
Jessica Pressman: That mermaids a part of explaining and making human knowledge and as Tara peterson writes in the soul academic monograph I could actually find on mermaids and and literature.

277
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:54.420
Jessica Pressman: On, on the other side of the screen quote at every turn the mermaid asks us to confront the mechanisms of knowledge production that bring her into focus and to interrogate the very processes of seeing and knowing and, to quote.

278
00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:04.050
Jessica Pressman: And peterson makes an important claim about the mermaid is figure that I want to take up, which is quote her identity takes shape only within a set of contingencies and quote.

279
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:13.020
Jessica Pressman: So I want to argue that a focus on the mermaid illuminates the cultural and historical context in which she appears contingencies, such as.

280
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:20.880
Jessica Pressman: The rise of Western imperialism colonialism and slavery emerging capitalism, the codification of gender roles and sexuality.

281
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:27.630
Jessica Pressman: And for me specifically and today, new communication technologies and our experiences with them.

282
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:39.660
Jessica Pressman: So to state my point more clearly the mermaid appears when contingencies change when media platform shift and when cultures begin to react to these facts and our experiences with them.

283
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:46.200
Jessica Pressman: So we can actually look to the mermaid to recognize shifting contexts for knowledge, production and meaning making.

284
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.360
Jessica Pressman: So peterson's focus is on the early modern period and the role of mermaids in it quote.

285
00:44:51.750 --> 00:45:00.570
Jessica Pressman: She writes sirens, are the principal iconography iconographic subject and illuminated manuscripts between the lines, and the ornamentation.

286
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:06.000
Jessica Pressman: of initial letters and headings in the margins of maps in would engravings etc and quote.

287
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:17.700
Jessica Pressman: mermaids to reverse the media platforms of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance from illuminated manuscripts to printed books and as peterson says again during the Renaissance, the sirens alert everywhere.

288
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:33.480
Jessica Pressman: mermaids appeared in maps to mark the unknown uncharted and quantified anything we can think of melodies questions of exactly how we quantify conditionality what constitutes as data what kinds of ways, do we see or not see.

289
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:40.680
Jessica Pressman: From scientific an objective knowledge quotes quotes right the were here there be monsters.

290
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:51.060
Jessica Pressman: The mermaid is part of the history of oceanic navigation central to the media and imagination of colonization but she is also a result of globalization.

291
00:45:51.360 --> 00:46:02.460
Jessica Pressman: mermaids adorn the masthead of ships as mark was showing us with that image of the mermaid as ship, in fact, with mermaids as mass heads they became part of the machinery of the ship.

292
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:14.730
Jessica Pressman: So as mass has a ship they explored and colonize the globe and they best cross the oceans as a Western figure to be transformed by indigenous cultures and indeed they work.

293
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:20.670
Jessica Pressman: In his famous study of mommy water, the great West African mermaid deity Henry jewel.

294
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:28.500
Jessica Pressman: explains that the earliest mermaid images were brought by sailors and merchants to Africa, probably by the Portuguese and the 15th century.

295
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:37.860
Jessica Pressman: But the image quickly transmuted in ocean crossings and cultural interactions so mami wata is decisively black and African quote.

296
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:44.610
Jessica Pressman: A product of trans cultural and transnational encounters and commercial transactions and voting rights.

297
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:53.940
Jessica Pressman: And jewel notes that mermaid figures and African diasporic cultures were often adorned with jewels pearls and other signifiers of wealth and commodity capitalism.

298
00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:02.250
Jessica Pressman: A vestige of her connection to Western colonizers and the captors of human beings who then turn humans into commodities and slave trade.

299
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:12.300
Jessica Pressman: there's been a kind of resurgence of mermaid sightings in recent years, and if you personally haven't heard the siren call, let me clue you in.

300
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:25.320
Jessica Pressman: A why they recognize mermaid craze has taken over popular culture and multimedia platforms for nearly a decade from popular TV shows, and why books to perspective mermaid tales patented, which was.

301
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:39.840
Jessica Pressman: dates from 2010 to the infamous hoax documentary some of you remember it and an animal planet to mermaids goals and professional mermaid jobs at resorts and hotels that's my next job I hope.

302
00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:58.770
Jessica Pressman: To a special issue of specialized academic journal an island cultures devoted to murder folk, and this is my bookshelf just have from the last few months of books across genres published since 2015 on mermaids so this leads us to.

303
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:13.680
Jessica Pressman: Our case study and electronic literature fishnet stockings which as you've already heard as an installation piece a wonderful installation piece that features mermaids essential to its content forum and experience so i'm going to.

304
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:22.260
Jessica Pressman: allow you to remember my my colleagues points about this work and instead jumped to the text, a little bit.

305
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.210
Jessica Pressman: where's the sound, can you hear the sound.

306
00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:28.680
Okay.

307
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.370
Jessica Pressman: You can see some of the text.

308
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:36.390
Jessica Pressman: and video, which is so lovely.

309
00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.190
Jessica Pressman: i'm going to.

310
00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.700
Jessica Pressman: move forward so that you can hear my voice as well.

311
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:54.210
Jessica Pressman: The text to fishnet stockings as mark described as mash up of a Twitter feed and the text from the most canonical mermaid story Hans Christian Andersen little mermaid from 1837 which Diana was talking about.

312
00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:04.590
Jessica Pressman: But fishnet stockings is not an adaptation of anderson's tale, it is instead of work that uses media to question how and why anderson's tale is the one that matters.

313
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:12.120
Jessica Pressman: And I think Diana beautifully What did she write beautifully stated that by saying it's an intervention or it's a state of intervention, perhaps into.

314
00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:25.470
Jessica Pressman: Our ideologies of mermaid newness and what they present so mermaids obviously existed for millennia before Anderson recall that Anderson never gave his heroin and name, she was an unknown figure.

315
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:30.930
Jessica Pressman: A type and, at the end of the story, a didactic lesson and Christian morality and sacrifice.

316
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:39.030
Jessica Pressman: it's disney's 1989 animated film that brought the Victorian short story to 20th century popular culture and media.

317
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:51.030
Jessica Pressman: canonized anderson's little mermaid and giving the heroine a name Ariel and happy heterosexual marriage much was changed in the remake but what we're made was the mermaids whiteness.

318
00:49:51.720 --> 00:50:01.290
Jessica Pressman: And for fishnet stockings to select anderson's tail as its origin point, and to do so in 2015, which is the moment of the swell of the contemporary mermaid praise.

319
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:14.820
Jessica Pressman: is important because this craze was also produced in part by news the Disney is remaking the little mermaid mermaid movie into a live action film and the actors playing Ariel it the little mermaid is black.

320
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:26.820
Jessica Pressman: And white here's here's more of the text sorry wonderful text the backlash to the announcement by Disney was swift and utterly disgusting with hashtags not my area.

321
00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:37.920
Jessica Pressman: writing for the New York Times, in the aftermath of this Tracy battista reminds us of the pitfalls of our lack of knowledge about mermaids she writes quote.

322
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:47.760
Jessica Pressman: The focus on Eurocentric stories and storytelling has done us a disservice leaving almost leaving most totally ignorant of the fact.

323
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:57.210
Jessica Pressman: That mermaid stories have been told throughout the African content for millenniums and quote and that taste, is a Caribbean American author, whose book series for young readers.

324
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:03.270
Jessica Pressman: works to fix this lacuna and that rise of the Japanese is a really great one with with mermaid characters that I love.

325
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:12.870
Jessica Pressman: fishnet stockings also offers interesting ways of subverting the ideologies of anderson's canonical tale and disney's appropriation of it.

326
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:23.400
Jessica Pressman: One way that the ila work does so is through the aesthetic of collage collage by its nature disrupts a sense of linearity stability or hierarchy.

327
00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:29.850
Jessica Pressman: The collage aesthetic at work here is very much indebted to print culture as the selected images show.

328
00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:39.210
Jessica Pressman: So just in the role of print and media more generally in the production of our knowledge of mermaids or lack of knowledge of mermaids and that's also a race.

329
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:51.930
Jessica Pressman: Along with larger myths and meetings that mermaids help to circulate in addition fishnet stockings contains imagery of sea creatures and monsters is there described in the code is mark stated.

330
00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:59.700
Jessica Pressman: That suggests an indigenous history of mermaids rather than a white Victorian one the imagery of monsters giambi is and powerful.

331
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.410
Jessica Pressman: Diabetes mixes with images.

332
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:15.000
Jessica Pressman: of textiles, as I think these ones, these images suggests textiles, of course, being an art form of folk and craft that has largely been marginalized by white Western culture that understands a cat art with a capital a.

333
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:28.620
Jessica Pressman: So fishnet stockings uses digital technologies to layer these visual references in ways that remind us that history and mermaid history, in particular, is long nonlinear and deserving of excavation.

334
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:38.190
Jessica Pressman: The mermaid is a hybrid beast and lives between air and water, sea and land she breaks boundaries and ruptures interfaces.

335
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:45.390
Jessica Pressman: This is a conference about platforms, presumably programmatic platforms for supporting digital information and melody turn that.

336
00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:53.790
Jessica Pressman: brilliantly into an epistemological question of what platform actually means and suggests, and the mermaid draws attention to platforms.

337
00:52:54.120 --> 00:53:05.610
Jessica Pressman: The surface of the ocean is her interface and her movement across it chat challenges notions of boundaries platforms and position ality Skype a Nick God describes the mermaid as a mystique.

338
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:13.830
Jessica Pressman: quote a quintessential border crosser and quote and mark, I think, was suggesting as much by bringing in airwaves so smart.

339
00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:21.450
Jessica Pressman: And in her history of the siren, which is the original bird imagery from which the half fish half lemon emerges.

340
00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:32.400
Jessica Pressman: Mary allow explains quote a bubble the siren is a hybrid half women half animal perpetually provocative and disturbing and quote.

341
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:45.780
Jessica Pressman: Precisely because the image of the mermaid is always in flux disturbing, it is important to trace her locations and transformation, so that we can understand when how and why the mermaid means.

342
00:53:46.170 --> 00:54:02.610
Jessica Pressman: In this context, fishnet stockings is not a one off work but rather one representative of a larger contemporary trend that deserves analysis for what it illuminates about our shifting digital culture and also electronic literature is important role within it, thank you.

343
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.890
Jessica Pressman: there's some of my mermaid stuff from from coven.

344
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:17.790
Jessica Pressman: All right, great we did really a good job on timing we've got we've got 15 minutes for for discussion for Q amp a.

345
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.050
Jessica Pressman: Welcome to type them in the chat.

346
00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.450
Jessica Pressman: or unmute.

347
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:37.320
Mark Marino: As long as we have to Ellen here just should we have her say, is it bad to call her on the spot and ask her if she wants to respond to anything that we've said about her work.

348
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.960
Joellyn J Rock: Oh brother.

349
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.040
Mark Marino: Sorry.

350
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:48.990
Joellyn J Rock: I just want to say that that was like that just made my heart sing all of those talks, you guys are doing beautiful work and.

351
00:54:50.280 --> 00:55:09.780
Joellyn J Rock: I could get I could get go down the path of like ooh did I make a racist work, but I think there's a lot of wonderful things said in each of those toxin and i'm you know jessica's last one brings up the idea of the illuminated manuscript and.

352
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.690
Joellyn J Rock: I wanted to just say that.

353
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:13.170
Joellyn J Rock: Though.

354
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:19.530
Joellyn J Rock: That was my intent in creating the work was that I could create a piece that.

355
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:34.470
Joellyn J Rock: Of illuminated art that writers would be invited to write into and that each of you like, I wish you all were sitting there texting and tweeting into the piece, as it has been displayed in various locations because.

356
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:42.270
Joellyn J Rock: that's the dialogue that i'd hoped for was you know let's let's challenge these things that we project on to.

357
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:51.450
Joellyn J Rock: Mark your point about dark skin not picking up by the CONNECT is just like super.

358
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:59.160
Joellyn J Rock: important for me to hear and think about as I test the project, when I wear all black it doesn't pick up my body.

359
00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:20.790
Joellyn J Rock: And so that's fascinating but I will say that my background as a visual artist has used silhouettes for 40 years okay so pre Kara Walker whose work I absolutely love, I was creating ceramic work that told stories with silhouettes because silhouettes or something we can project on to.

360
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.920
Joellyn J Rock: And we can.

361
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:35.310
Joellyn J Rock: You know there, but I think the racial issues are need to be grappled with and the last little thing I want to say about the history of the project is that.

362
00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:49.350
Joellyn J Rock: It was created for the conference invite at Bergen and the show was to be a show about hybrid of it Okay, so that the word hybrid was.

363
00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:59.400
Joellyn J Rock: From the beginning about what the work was about and also seaport was because we I live in duluth Minnesota, which is a seaport, believe it or not.

364
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:08.580
Joellyn J Rock: And was bringing a piece of work to Bergen Norway that's a seaport and that was sort of I work with fairy tales so that was the root of.

365
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:22.470
Joellyn J Rock: attaching to mermaids I I and also allison Ani we actually hate the Disney version of the little mermaid so we were in bands of that and wanted to do something that people could write into.

366
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:25.860
Mark Marino: One of the things that I just want to bring up, first of all.

367
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:31.470
Mark Marino: It we we love this work and the more we look at it, the more we love it, I think, but I just want to say one thing which is.

368
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.850
Mark Marino: We didn't talk about something that's featured on the website, which is.

369
00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:44.370
Mark Marino: That those allison Ani cutouts were inspired by we as you attributed Hans Christian Andersen practice.

370
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:51.780
Mark Marino: Of this, cutting storytelling pieces you've got we can show some images, but you've got that you've got at least one image on your website of.

371
00:57:52.260 --> 00:58:01.830
Mark Marino: right there like snowflakes right how you there folded up their cut and I can only assume when they're opened up, they show something you didn't expect to be there.

372
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:12.330
Mark Marino: And to me that's such a beautiful compliment to your piece, and the way the layers come together for the way the the code works, the way the Twitter works and they're all these ways in which there it's an.

373
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:18.780
Mark Marino: I think melody said this, that it is a it's an emergent piece that this sort of happens.

374
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:25.260
Mark Marino: In collaboration with the audience and then in surprising ways I says, but I suspect, every time.

375
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.180
Joellyn J Rock: Well, and if people don't know Hans Christian Andersen would.

376
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:48.000
Joellyn J Rock: Do these paper cuts, as he told stories to a group of children and that there would be this sort of reveal of the unfolded things so a lot of the aesthetic of the pieces trying to echo that but that material experience yeah.

377
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:58.650
Melody Jue: that's really interesting i'll have to think more about that, but I love the idea that storytelling is also about the yeah cutting through the folded paper and then bringing it out.

378
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:11.880
Melody Jue: And I just realized we didn't go there in our presentations today, but I think there's a connection to trans studies so either hayward has a really great piece on starfish and limb regeneration.

379
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:26.970
Melody Jue: And she writes about the regenerative cut, so I think there's also connections, not just to mermaid hybridity but also thinking through the ways that yeah people like Eva hayward have thought through sea creatures and the cut and like this.

380
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.150
Melody Jue: These other senses of.

381
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:43.710
Melody Jue: generation so, so I think there's a lot of different ways we could take the the fold and the cut across media forms but then also think about them, particularly in in the ocean for those implications.

382
00:59:44.760 --> 01:00:00.060
Melody Jue: This takes us in a little bit of a different direction, but I wanted to just say one other thing since we're thinking, since you know, this is an event conference and we're thinking through across forums so seawater and code and one thing i've.

383
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:13.500
Melody Jue: been interested in a while ago and thinking about a life was when his code and environment versus an object and how do you tell or there are cases where it signifies kind of as as both.

384
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:20.010
Melody Jue: And one element of fishnet stockings that kind of caught my attention with us was the jellyfish.

385
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:32.340
Melody Jue: Because jellyfish are creatures that depend on having a hydro skeleton so, in other words, if you take them out of water, they collapse, but in the water they're supported and boyd by.

386
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:51.630
Melody Jue: The water holding them up and holding them together so they can move comfortably so I wonder if the jellyfish is a type of sea creature that dramatize is a case where it's hard to separate animal from environment or environment from object in a particular kind of way.

387
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:57.540
Melody Jue: I think I really love that.

388
01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:07.950
Mark Marino: I love that that quote you said melody when his code and environment and how can you tell and the one one thing that that springs to mind i'm not sure if it's worth pursuing those.

389
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:20.400
Mark Marino: The website frames this piece as a as for its processing code, but it's processing code wouldn't operate without it's Java code and then a few other back end things.

390
01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:30.630
Mark Marino: That, I could not separate out, even though I since I first thought I would be able to, and then I thought oh I gotta gotta go into reading Java for a little bit.

391
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.650
Mark Marino: So yeah I don't know i'm just gonna sit with that quote for the next year and a half.

392
01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:44.220
Diana Leong: This might be a really simplistic question, but how does code recognize hybridity.

393
01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:52.680
Diana Leong: That was simple question.

394
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.720
Mark Marino: Just not as simple question, and again I think it brings when we were talking about racing the lit.

395
01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:03.240
Mark Marino: I think the only the number one reference that came to mind was fox her l's work.

396
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.690
Mark Marino: And I think more than any scholar he's someone who's wrestling with.

397
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:19.770
Mark Marino: What it means to register an identity beyond cattery simple categories.

398
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:35.820
Mark Marino: And he thinks about this in rich ways of self identification again alternatives to the census style classifications of any of any being or creature so.

399
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.910
Mark Marino: But that's only an initial thought on that.

400
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.910
Mark Marino: And we have a comment in the chat from krista Lea I don't know krista leave you want to say that.

401
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:01.800
Mark Marino: comment.

402
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.860
Rob Wittig: Okay okay she's just not okay that's fine.

403
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.790
Mark Marino: I see him from rob.

404
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.130
Rob Wittig: yeah I wanted to.

405
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:36.090
Rob Wittig: Really really interesting toxin and Nice interweaving among them, and I wanted to follow up on something that JESSICA touched on, and ask all the panelists about the kind of sense of the commercial aspect of the mermaid.

406
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.960
Rob Wittig: mermaid itself herself themself.

407
01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:50.610
Rob Wittig: And that, with the jewels and so on, and because one of the things that that stuck with me the most strongly from fishnet stockings was.

408
01:03:52.350 --> 01:04:03.060
Rob Wittig: In the same way that Cinderella is kind of meditation on what is our society do with orphans like what do we do with how do we treat orphans what happens to orphans that.

409
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:08.460
Rob Wittig: The kind of folk tales that Anderson is drawing from for the little mermaid or about.

410
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:21.360
Rob Wittig: Giving in quotes or selling or trading women to into marriage into another town where it's like okay you're going to have to go to this other town as a part of a trading arrangement or a.

411
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:33.240
Rob Wittig: Political arrangement, or you know, to stop a coral or something like that, and where the little mermaid is kind of is the archetype of the fish out of water.

412
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:39.480
Rob Wittig: somebody who is in a new situation they're uncomfortable they don't know the language, maybe they have an accent.

413
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:58.200
Rob Wittig: They come from a super different place and I love it's always struck me that boy as a symbol of being of moving from one society one culture to another going from underwater to on land is like this really powerful symbol so but just reflections on on that aspect of it.

414
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:04.080
Melody Jue: Can I ask JESSICA a related question just to piggyback on here too i'm.

415
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.280
Melody Jue: Really really briefly.

416
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:11.580
Melody Jue: I was wondering like when mermaids intersect with like commodity thinking our history is so like in the Disney version.

417
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:19.860
Melody Jue: she's it's not just you know there's the the theme about the voice and losing the voice, but then also like ariel's a hoarder she has all the terrestrial objects under under.

418
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:34.560
Melody Jue: Like when does the economic you know enter into the history of mermaids stories or the fetishization of commodities that we see in Disney because I suspect it's earlier but really.

419
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.360
Jessica Pressman: it's it's.

420
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:40.620
Jessica Pressman: I mean, from the beginning, depending on how you describe it, certainly in the early modern period.

421
01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:51.300
Jessica Pressman: She is this becomes a symbol of capitalism and and colonization and and the mercantile slave trade and just mercantilism is in general she's also used.

422
01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:56.550
Jessica Pressman: Tara Peter since book, I mean it's like really the only book I could find that's an academic monograph.

423
01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:07.680
Jessica Pressman: About mermaids and literary culture and it's really great actually and she she describes Queen Elizabeth having mermaids on her throne as a kind of symbol of of.

424
01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:19.710
Jessica Pressman: of globalization of power, but even with the sirens in the history of the sirens, going back to Ancient Greece they're associated with knowledge and power and the kind of.

425
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:31.470
Jessica Pressman: and also with music and this kind of having access, so if you it wasn't just their ability to learn sailors, to the depths into the into the dead, but it's more of an Eve story.

426
01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:39.840
Jessica Pressman: Of that they had a certain kind of knowledge that link to the the harmonious harmonious spheres of true knowledge that.

427
01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:47.580
Jessica Pressman: people wanted to access so there's a kind of they possess, and so they people want to possess them.

428
01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:57.780
Jessica Pressman: So it's there from the beginning that's why I think diana's point about fetishization is so so important, I don't think there's a separation of the commodity or the marketplaces rob says.

429
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:10.380
Jessica Pressman: I think that's a really that's something i'm becoming really interested in especially linking it back to platforms is that it's it's not just fairy tales or stories or symbols there's always a material embodiment that really matters.

430
01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:25.380
Mark Marino: And I think it's worth noting again when I when I love about Jones work is that because she invited in audience participation and because of her own relationship to these myths it.

431
01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:31.860
Mark Marino: Her verte there's no her version of the little mermaid tail like she opens it up for.

432
01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:43.800
Mark Marino: The multiplicity of readings that that the inner actors bring with their association so whether they bring it with them on Twitter so whether you know again just thinking about the title of act three.

433
01:07:44.580 --> 01:08:02.640
Mark Marino: or four fishnet three that it's bad bargains and good exchange rates, so I don't know it see and we played in definitely when we were playing on the Twitter, you know the sort of net profit side of it we people took it in whatever direction they they felt so.

434
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.610
Diana Leong: In general, and I just, I just wanted to say part of what I.

435
01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.040
Diana Leong: What I really liked about reading your work in conjunction with Carol walker's is, I think that there is a.

436
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:26.700
Diana Leong: Significant and substantial overlap between the processes that the viewer goes through when they look at Walker spark and what the participants are doing when they are sort of immersed in the in the space of your installations sort of.

437
01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:42.240
Diana Leong: Drawing out the psychic structures that we use to relate to different things right, which is precisely what walk of work does, but in this sort of event environment, you can actually look at the structures that make that possible type of instructors possible.

438
01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:53.670
Joellyn J Rock: Well, I thanks for saying that because I think what Walker is doing to is taking this non scary thing of these sort of children's book illustrated.

439
01:08:54.480 --> 01:09:05.820
Joellyn J Rock: silhouettes that are go way back their their domestic and they're sweet and and then learning a sin to look at something that's difficult to see.

440
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:26.940
Joellyn J Rock: You know that shocking and disturbing by by that bait and switch of decorative art, you know and that's something that i've always been really fascinated with it's like can I it's a feminist act really to take something of decorative art and in embed an conversation into it right.

441
01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:31.500
Diana Leong: If you look at the figures from a distance, they look whimsical until you.

442
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:47.400
Joellyn J Rock: This piece fishnet stockings is supposed to be really beautiful, you know or lush color wise and texture wise, but if you came into it and wanted to discuss these more difficult things like sex trafficking.

443
01:09:48.540 --> 01:10:00.840
Joellyn J Rock: which was also another reason why I did it because we were in duluth Minnesota at that time discovering that there was a really bad problem in our port with sex trafficking of indigenous women.

444
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:13.830
Joellyn J Rock: In our port, so I was thinking about those issues a lot, and you know you can create something really pretty and then see what happens when people move in closer and think about it, I know.

445
01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:20.040
Jessica Pressman: Well, I think the work I.

446
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:28.650
Jessica Pressman: mean we originally was just interested, I was interested in it, because mermaids but it's so compelling and there's so many layers and we have kaitlin.

447
01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:31.470
Jessica Pressman: that's just great.

448
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.760
Caitlin Fisher: I do get cricket and research on snapchat about like what kind of what comes up there's also like an aerial that goes right in front of your face and.

449
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.560
Caitlin Fisher: wow.

450
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:44.880
Jessica Pressman: there's a reason that you are the Queen of electronic literature here.

451
01:10:46.650 --> 01:11:01.680
Jessica Pressman: um no but it's a wonderful work and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring it and I i'm hopeful that we can continue doing some work together, you all, because it was really fascinating fascinating to hear your ideas and how they came together and i'm aware.

452
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:02.520
Jessica Pressman: we're out.

453
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:15.930
Joellyn J Rock: I just want to thank you all for talking about the work you know it's super meaningful for artists to people take a critical look at their work and contextualize it that way, and I I just thank you all.

454
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.510
Mark Marino: Well, thank, thank you for making it, and again I mean just as the person who is reading the code.

455
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.620
Mark Marino: I just have to thank your whole team, because it is so well documented.

456
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:35.490
Mark Marino: It is a pleasure to read and you know again when someone begins at code exploration when they put on their dive suit you know, usually it's with some trepidation and.

457
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:48.270
Mark Marino: happiness because it's trying to trace through somebody's tangled net is not a pleasant activity, but here was so so so well documented and had so many delightful aspects to it, all the way through out.

458
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:50.400
Mark Marino: That I, I look forward to.

459
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:52.560
Mark Marino: Future future dives into it.

460
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.260
Jessica Pressman: This is just marks like.

461
01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.560
Jessica Pressman: ultimate joy is having something that he can play with cleanse with for over an hour and melodies like.

462
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.800
Mark Marino: melody to she's she's she's an honorary dead joker at this point.

463
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:12.660
Jessica Pressman: Well y'all Thank you so much for joining us and my fellow panelists, thank you for the elimination i'm so grateful.

464
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.110
Jessica Pressman: Good to see everyone oh caitlin.

465
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:21.450
Mark Marino: you're almost later years later.

466
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.520
Jessica Pressman: I don't know how to do that.

467
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.850
Mark Marino: Go to her picture in the little grid view and.

468
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.080
Caitlin Fisher: Now.

469
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.370
Jessica Pressman: They do it.

470
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:30.540
Mark Marino: There you go yeah.

471
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.010
Caitlin Fisher: yeah that's.

472
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:46.050
Mark Marino: Nice and, by the way, we can continue this conversation, by the way, on track one in the discord you can also find this in there at the CAFE pull us aside for, for you know, a sailor's tale or two.

473
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:49.230
Jessica Pressman: hi everyone, thank you.

474
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.940
Caitlin Fisher: I was so wonderful Thank you.
