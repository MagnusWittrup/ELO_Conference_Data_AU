01:53:45	Track one: Conference Admin:	Sorry all, minor malfunction
01:54:11	Track one: Conference Admin:	Don’t know what happened, good thing you just started anyway :-)
01:55:11	Maria Mencia:	hello, I won’t be able to stay too long because I have to chair another session.  I will have a look at the recording afterwards.
01:56:17	Deena Larsen:	Arts is VITAL to elit!
01:56:43	Deena Larsen:	We have been working on interactive multithreaded games and films in elit for three decades now.
02:03:30	Lillian-Yvonne Bertram:	The description of the artistic approach is helpful, thank you!
02:04:16	Roberta Iadevaia:	all clear, thank you
02:05:21	Deena Larsen:	I am so sorry, but my camera does not work
02:05:40	Deena Larsen:	So you will have to use your imagination :P
02:05:59	Steven Malliet:	No problem at all :-) No pressure! :-)
02:11:41	Deena Larsen:	So you can have a quick summary/reminder of people's work as a basis of conversation
02:16:13	Deena Larsen:	I love the idea of the mutual shared feelings --getting people who are passionate about Elit together is so important.
02:16:25	Deena Larsen:	We can feel together in the same interests.
02:18:40	Deena Larsen:	online workshops allow multithreaded interactions. In the Second Tuesday Salons, we find that we can keep attention by having both a lively chat and a lively interaction in the zoom
02:22:03	Deena Larsen:	We need to include these events on the ELO calendar!
02:22:35	Deena Larsen:	World wide meetings are difficult--it is fun to see the different time zones
02:23:16	Steven Malliet:	It is indeed very difficult to schedule :-) Especially when some countries changed to summer time, and others didn't :-)
02:25:29	Deena Larsen:	https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/
02:26:03	Deena Larsen:	So we need a "low tech barrier" and I love the idea of wonder...and reactions to the song.
02:26:45	Deena Larsen:	THe song is very similar to Bob Dylan's Blowing in the wind...
02:27:57	Deena Larsen:	So the Mistress is a bot--to remix the wonders
02:28:14	Deena Larsen:	As a filler for tech difficulties or the dreaded silence. good idea.
02:28:22	Steven Malliet:	yes exactly :-)
02:34:14	Maria Mencia:	Thank you all, I have to go now.
02:34:59	Christian Ulrik Andersen:	We see only “distant bodies and accomplices”
02:37:47	Deena Larsen:	These also need to be on the ELO calendar!
02:38:09	Deena Larsen:	I like the idea of an invitation to conspire-
02:38:13	Deena Larsen:	to create together
02:38:37	Deena Larsen:	to breathe together --we are our writing. we breathe our words
02:40:38	Deena Larsen:	Rules are made to be broken
02:42:27	Deena Larsen:	THis has a lot of links to fan fic and world building three
02:42:33	Deena Larsen:	there
02:48:12	Deena Larsen:	Can you provide the LARP URLs?
02:48:41	Deena Larsen:	Yes, too often the internet allows you to hide and harm... emphasizing the responsibility to others is critical
02:53:15	Steven Malliet:	The full program is online at https://0ct0p0s.net/Symposium-Blend-Bleed
02:53:55	Steven Malliet:	I think you can find most links from there on, but we can ask the organisers of ELO if there are more convient ways of sharing this
02:57:48	Deena Larsen:	Separate experiences together
03:04:39	Patrick Lichty:	Thank you for this link.
03:04:40	Deena Larsen:	Please put the announcement to the upcoming LARPS in the chat?
