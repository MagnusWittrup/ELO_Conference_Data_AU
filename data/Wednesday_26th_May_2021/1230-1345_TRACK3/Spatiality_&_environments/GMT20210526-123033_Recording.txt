00:34:15	Søren Bro Pold:	The piece is also part of the Platforming Utopias exhibition.
00:34:19	Improv Media & Performance Lab:	Applause!
00:34:39	Jennifer Dellner:	Applause! + @Andréa - is the 3-D environment for VR?
00:34:55	Mark Marino:	great question
00:35:30	Vinícius UFMT:	Q @Andrea: Did you get inspiration from other navigatable environments by Brazilian artists, such as Alckmar Santos or Chico Marinho
00:35:32	Andréa Catrópa:	Jennifer, not yet...just because of the pandemic. We couldn´t try it now in VR...but, maybe, we will try it on VR later
00:36:29	Jennifer Dellner:	Thank you
00:36:45	Leonardo Flores:	I think the immersive aspect of the environment would work nicely.
00:36:48	Leonardo Flores:	In VR.
00:37:02	Andréa Catrópa:	Yes, Leonardo!
00:37:06	Leonardo Flores:	Reinforcing the dreamlike quality.
00:37:10	Jennifer Dellner:	Agree
00:38:01	Søren Bro Pold:	Q
00:38:27	Andréa Catrópa:	We´ll have a virtual vernissage on June 19th to test some possibilities with users. I will discuss this VR idea with Felipe and with the "audience"
00:39:45	Leonardo Flores:	At the same time, don’t feel pressured to raise the technical stakes of your creative work. VR development is a whole other level of technical production and expertise.
00:39:47	Jeremy Hight:	was on a panel in silicon alley once on future ar...still gives me the willies   this is fascinating work
00:40:07	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Q for Boyd and Piotr, is there documentation of any of the performances you can send us a link to?
00:40:13	Richard Carter:	Indeed! Thank you
00:40:54	Mark Marino:	q:Richard can u talk more about the esolang u have created?
00:40:54	Piotr (he/him) London:	Yes! Thank you. Our website is https://improbotics.org
00:40:58	Improv Media & Performance Lab:	Here is one of our shows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QePlDFR09o&t=1031s
00:41:25	Improv Media & Performance Lab:	More about us: https://improbotics.org/
00:42:00	Alessia Pannese:	Q please for Andréa
00:43:41	Daria Petrova:	Thanks for links!
00:47:26	Jeremy Hight:	yes in design theory   it has been called the surface fetish
00:48:07	Scott Rettberg:	A drop in the ocean is one more drop than it had before.
00:48:29	Richard Carter:	Absolutely
00:48:35	Søren Bro Pold:	Thanks, great answers!
00:50:06	Helen Burgess:	richard do you have a public repo for the code?
00:52:30	Richard Carter:	Not yet! It's currently still being tweaked and worked on, but once it is compiled into a finished artist's book, the code will be featured
01:02:16	Stephanie Strickland:	https://theaterofwar.com/about
01:04:09	Stephanie Strickland:	theater of war very creative adjustment to Zoom performance    esp.  way large live audience interacts and film actors do theater work  in Zoom upclose shots from their homes
01:05:56	Daria Petrova:	Rimini Protokoll stager a zoom version of this peace: https://www.rimini-protokoll.de/website/en/project/call-cutta-at-home
01:06:01	Daria Petrova:	staged
01:06:57	Piotr (he/him) London:	I was going to ask! :-D
01:07:08	Daria Petrova:	Very excited with Improbotics project
01:09:28	Helen Burgess:	Q: is there a Turing test for art?
01:09:43	Richard Carter:	*Now that is a question!
01:10:09	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	Leo makes a great point about bot's working because of brevity. One related challenge to longer computer-generated text is its weaknesses in recalling and building on information already established within a narrative.
01:12:44	Daria Petrova:	Are you allowing the audience to take part in improvisation, or is it just for the actors?
01:13:35	Leonardo Flores:	That’s a neat way of addressing Zach’s comment on continuity.
01:13:37	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	@Piotr is that GPT-2?
01:14:09	Mark Marino:	thinking also of netprov and malthes performance last night
01:14:21	Leonardo Flores:	Cyborg generation. Love it!
01:14:49	Mark Marino:	q: since audience feedback is so important in improv comedy esp., how do u provide actors with that?
01:15:21	Leonardo Flores:	Thank you!
01:17:40	Piotr (he/him) London:	Yes, GPT-2 was a huge leap for us. We started using GPT-3 recently, which. enables “one-shot” learning on the spot of specific relationships between concepts at runtime, e.g., “Joke: … Punchline: ...“
01:18:32	Piotr (he/him) London:	@Daria: we allow the audience to select lines, by inviting them on stage or sharing a tablet with line suggestions generated by the AI.
01:19:03	Piotr (he/him) London:	@Daria: we also managed to get 1-minute exchanges b/w audience members and ELIZA (1966)!
01:19:19	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	This is a project that may be of interest related to the AI robotic conversations: https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/conversations-with-bina48.html
01:19:30	Vinícius UFMT:	Great presentations! Congrats to all panelists!
01:19:35	Piotr (he/him) London:	Thank you @Andrew!
01:19:36	Leonardo Flores:	Thank you all!
01:19:36	Andréa Catrópa:	I am very curious to see all the Works!
01:19:39	Daria Petrova:	@Piotr, thank you. ELIZA is great!
01:19:39	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Thank you!!
01:19:40	Leonardo Flores:	Great presentations!
01:19:44	Alessia Pannese:	Thank you all!
