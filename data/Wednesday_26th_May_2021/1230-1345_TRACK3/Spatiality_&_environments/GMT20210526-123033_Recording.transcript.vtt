00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.400
Helen Burgess: Hello everybody so Erin was that your Jingle.

2
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.280
Helen Burgess: Excellent.

3
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.060
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Thank you.

4
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.900
well.

5
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.800
Helen Burgess: Welcome to track the three.

6
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.630
Helen Burgess: Of.

7
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.670
Helen Burgess: The yellow conference and our track is entitled.

8
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.510
Helen Burgess: speciality and environments and we have four speakers or groups of speakers today.

9
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:18.420
Helen Burgess: The organizers have asked me to try and keep you all to five minutes, so I will bump you in some way, if you start running over too long, and I hope we can have a very lively discussion.

10
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.930
Helen Burgess: In this this room, this this morning, this afternoon, this evening, wherever you happen to be so the order I have you in on the program is.

11
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:46.800
Helen Burgess: schlumberger priya tea and Deborah certain followed by boyd branch peered and mirror our ski corey Matheson followed by rich Carter followed by Andrea control so we'll stick to the order and see how we go does that sound good.

12
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.370
Helen Burgess: Already so let's start out with some some of the Korea and Deborah.

13
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.750
Shanmuga priya: Hello.

14
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.330
Shanmuga priya: Hello hey.

15
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.180
Shanmuga priya: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening everyone I just shared the screen.

16
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.580
Shanmuga priya: I hope you're.

17
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.990
Shanmuga priya: able to see my screen.

18
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.990
Helen Burgess: Yes, we can see it.

19
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.700
Shanmuga priya: Thank you.

20
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:38.880
Shanmuga priya: i'm going to present the presentation is titled as last water remains key transformational What escapes in crime to from past to present through step by tree.

21
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.780
Shanmuga priya: Basically, this is still poetry, is the result of our editors who sponsored project, Mr innovation in water scarcity, employment or in India.

22
00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:02.640
Shanmuga priya: In this project we study how the water bodies from this region climate took from British period to current how they transformed, and what are the implications such like water scarcity and all.

23
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.420
Shanmuga priya: The presentation, so this tells me manatees additional literature.

24
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:26.400
Shanmuga priya: These fields may look two different distinct fields, but they have common fundamental approach towards creativity distill it he produces creative works lister humanities applies create a method for studying what's of humanities disciplines.

25
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:40.650
Shanmuga priya: coma they can be part of each other, for example, Mr matt is can are can easily or not, the creative process of electronic potential for building it mattered organization production and dissemination.

26
00:03:41.130 --> 00:04:03.390
Shanmuga priya: and, similarly, since the 90s in the stickiness what Mr Boehner which ties to materials by using digital technologies, they can also be employed to study, Mr creative works, so in such case we actually use this to literature as a method to as an effort to agency to represent and communicate.

27
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.630
Shanmuga priya: The research.

28
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.590
Shanmuga priya: This is finding to the broader public.

29
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.900
Shanmuga priya: So last water remain scape the district attorney's written in Tamil by him from other fee and English by myself and the information.

30
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:38.340
Shanmuga priya: about the waterfall is the poetry is also written by myself this fighter has both 2d and 3D environments, which are creative banter and i'd open emitted software and others the software as well, and we kept them listen is the primary team of our district poetry.

31
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:53.700
Shanmuga priya: So this poetry has various various entities like text maps animations and photos in general waterboarding, so our primary resources for drinking irrigation and other economic, cultural activities in the climate Yun jie.

32
00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:09.270
Shanmuga priya: How, whether or garden What escapes due to draft climate change and mismanagement, they have become conducive conditions all for training drainage, and the wisdom thing areas, the photos which we have tackled during our field mcs.

33
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:22.440
Shanmuga priya: show the current condition of water bodies and most I mean very few of them are like oh instill in working better condition, but few of them are like very impacted will state.

34
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:32.490
Shanmuga priya: So, but on the other hand, the word is tamales which we collected from the locker people not it, how they were blessed to have a healthy water escape in the past.

35
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:51.840
Shanmuga priya: So basically our interactive show pipe dream and proprietary visitation to search last water scabs created based on the historical and literally takes and water this morning's it will also probably try because it's not what steps before turning nation and acceleration.

36
00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:12.360
Shanmuga priya: The image, you see, I mean the first have we have we are divided our additional point during the primary layers The first one is historical maps this 19th century historical matter or kyrie National Library of Scotland and we actually despite all these maps to our project and the.

37
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:22.500
Shanmuga priya: The shiny elements, you see the image in the map the present the river, which is called as new year, which was one of the primary resource.

38
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:32.730
Shanmuga priya: When, in the past, but now they were releasing to like drainage mostly drainage, and you know urbanization and other pollution activities.

39
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:45.270
Shanmuga priya: And the red shiny elements, you see, that is, represent the water tanks are which actually created during the last period which is almost like approximately 1000 years ago.

40
00:06:46.170 --> 00:07:00.810
Shanmuga priya: But most of the answer disappeared and some of them are shrinking and well if you're in pain condition, so the flip the user will play with all these elements to know about the water steps and what our bodies, and also that they can also.

41
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:15.270
Shanmuga priya: Read the poetry, along with all these entities and we have also have created to be 3D environments of particular they're important water bodies of the region, based on her experience from the local.

42
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.840
Shanmuga priya: Local studies and also from the historical and it takes, so the user can play with all these entities.

43
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.560
Shanmuga priya: And and honestly, you know, create a photon emission of the current condition of madness caps so as you see the different kinds of photos also represent the.

44
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:50.910
Shanmuga priya: situation, the water parties and the user or the plan can also interact with these photos and poetry, which, in which you can be embedded with this course, so they can understand the situation different situations.

45
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.470
Shanmuga priya: Are the main aim of this poetry is to create admissions among the.

46
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:12.180
Shanmuga priya: Public and we will be sharing this district by trade or local schools and colleges and we are also collecting feedback from the students and badly and all of these feedbacks and destroyed by it will be hosted on our website, thank you.

47
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.820
Helen Burgess: Thank you very much, that looks like a fascinating project.

48
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.780
Helen Burgess: alrighty so.

49
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:40.080
Helen Burgess: We should hold a questions and comments until the end, but if you have a question, while you're while you're just thinking.

50
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:54.600
Helen Burgess: Through and listening just feel free to drop a Q or a plus in the chat to let me know you'd like to ask a question at the end, and if you have a question, but you don't want your voice recorded, you can also drop it in the chat.

51
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.650
Helen Burgess: alrighty so next up, we have what branch theater murawski and corey Matheson.

52
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.510
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Hello i'm boyd branch.

53
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.540
Piotr (he/him) London: i'm i'm pure me lawsky.

54
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:19.890
Improv Media & Performance Lab: And we're hailing from spaceship and probiotics we're going to be talking about our project called the virtual director and rosetta code.

55
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:29.370
Improv Media & Performance Lab: So, since we have a short amount of time you won't jump into our bios to extensively but i'm at the University of Kent and I do research and detail immersive.

56
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.900
Improv Media & Performance Lab: theater.

57
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:45.330
Piotr (he/him) London: And i'm a resort sciences at declined, and in my spare time I do improv with robots within probiotics.

58
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.700
Piotr (he/him) London: Just a question, do you hear an ECHO when I speak.

59
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.280
Scott Rettberg: Oh sounds good.

60
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.770
Piotr (he/him) London: sounds good okay perfect.

61
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:07.770
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Alright, so we're gonna give you a brief sort of background of what the virtual director project was and then we'll talk about briefly one of the projects that we.

62
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.670
Improv Media & Performance Lab: engaged to where the using the software.

63
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:24.930
Improv Media & Performance Lab: So many live performers struggle with the desire to be live and in the moment as possible while dealing with the physical and possibilities introduced by a virtual improvisation, the laws of physics, that is.

64
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:42.930
Improv Media & Performance Lab: The speed of light defines a theoretical maximum for the speed of information transfer, this is the maximum rate at which information from one performer can reach the other performer or an audience observer so when audience are performing or co located in a theater this language and.

65
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:53.580
Improv Media & Performance Lab: This information can happen at the speed of sound for jokes Laughter and applause at the speed of light for the body language and scenic painting.

66
00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.170
Improv Media & Performance Lab: When performers are not co located, however, with audience members, it takes an insignificant and not insignificant amount of time for the information.

67
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:11.940
Improv Media & Performance Lab: round trip to occur while this is generally understood as a half Second, it can feel like a lifetime most platforms must be designed in such a way.

68
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.780
Improv Media & Performance Lab: to handle issues of latency and lag introduced by these delays and, as the number one rule and comedy is timing.

69
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.870
Improv Media & Performance Lab: handling these issues effectively is paramount for translating the comedy from the performer to the observer.

70
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:33.420
Improv Media & Performance Lab: To theaters around the world have tried many different ways to incorporate live and pre recorded content for performance hosting an audience interaction, but the platforms.

71
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:40.440
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Often stand in the way rather than up lift those engagements and so these tools, need to be easy enough for performers to use.

72
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:56.910
Improv Media & Performance Lab: and improve audience enjoyment so to handle these requirements we built this platform for online performance, so that we're calling the virtual director, which enables actors to simulate feelings of being present like Peter, and I, in the space together.

73
00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.040
Improv Media & Performance Lab: with each other.

74
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:10.800
Improv Media & Performance Lab: So our research combines Cinematic and video communication technologies with a theatrical practice of improvisational unscripted beat or an aimed at recreating presence.

75
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:22.770
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Virtually so virtual director relies on commodity software, in this case touch designer and web browsers like Google chrome too wide widely adopted video conferencing tools like zoom or Microsoft teams.

76
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.940
Improv Media & Performance Lab: For our solution, so we essentially piggyback on these digital media platforms for streaming and video conferencing for participating.

77
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:44.130
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Online with these performances, so this makes using the tools easy as essentially using just your common software, they can get off the shelf these tools have evolved significantly within this year.

78
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:56.700
Improv Media & Performance Lab: of development and global dependence for telework and education to software, such as open broadcast software and even zoom's Google meets capabilities have improved significantly in this last year.

79
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.130
Improv Media & Performance Lab: So full system description is sort of out of the scope of this particular work.

80
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:13.440
Improv Media & Performance Lab: But for those of you that are interested in, you have a few different publications that go into that so Peter is now going to talk about one of the projects that we used us with the software.

81
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:21.450
Piotr (he/him) London: Yes, so we are international theater troupe we have cast members from multiple nationalities and languages.

82
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:32.220
Piotr (he/him) London: And it began to explore multilingual improvisational formats with live translation and speech recognition in the loop and the appropriately now.

83
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:39.150
Piotr (he/him) London: called Michelle rosetta code, so we use the Google API for speech recognition.

84
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:59.070
Piotr (he/him) London: Real lifetime translation and Texas degeneration and build a program to listen to improvisers speaking in language foreign to her see partner and to send them near real time translation via a headset as well as displaying the result of speech recognition in real time on a screen.

85
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:09.390
Piotr (he/him) London: That show was initially staged physically on on an actual stage and then embraced the possibilities given by.

86
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.860
Piotr (he/him) London: Online shows to have real.

87
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:22.380
Piotr (he/him) London: Time translation appearing on the screen in speech bubbles above the performance, so that performance could speak in one language.

88
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:37.350
Piotr (he/him) London: Have the language translated into another language and then communicate with a second performer who would speak a third language and then communicated back into this lingua franca shared between them.

89
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:53.100
Piotr (he/him) London: And our system takes advantage of virtual environments in order to provide a cohesive narrative experience and the context of others multilingual improv appearing in the same virtual location.

90
00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:02.670
Piotr (he/him) London: So I think we are close to the end of the talk because we timed it at 15 minutes and we condensed it in real time to Phi.

91
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.230
Piotr (he/him) London: boyd.

92
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:15.390
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Indeed, we have so we're happy to answer questions at the end of the session for more information and we do have a paper associated with this this talk that you should be able to access.

93
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:21.720
Piotr (he/him) London: And we would love to thank the organizers of this conference for this opportunity, thank you.

94
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.360
Helen Burgess: hey thank you both lawyers.

95
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.540
Helen Burgess: alrighty.

96
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.350
Helen Burgess: Okay next up, we have Richard Carter with executable landscapes.

97
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:48.810
Richard Carter: hello, thank you, let me just share my screen i've timed my time my presentation at five sort of five minutes 30 seconds So hopefully will be.

98
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:58.770
Richard Carter: Be just within So if I bring that up, hopefully, you can see my my PowerPoint there and let's let's make a start, then so.

99
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:10.980
Richard Carter: got five minutes i'm going to be very fast in essence my papers predication the question that interests me a lot digital art and literature is entangle mine necessity on systems platforms.

100
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.610
Richard Carter: That are actively damaging the earthly environment as an aspect of their functioning their maintenance and their reproduction.

101
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.400
Richard Carter: And I think this poses many important critical questions these practices can be more they can mean.

102
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:35.520
Richard Carter: i'm particularly interested in exploring this my paper, how can digital literature help chart different spectrums of futures concerning digital technology so, in other words, how can it help us think through.

103
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:46.680
Richard Carter: What kinds of activities or artifacts or infrastructures might emerge if the latter took took on board and active radically upon the critiques to which they are often subjected to.

104
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:56.790
Richard Carter: i'm particularly interested what other forms of knowing and being might be realized by digital sensors and data driven loads of sense, making our.

105
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:07.710
Richard Carter: Environment it's profoundly predicated on sensory systems and data gathering to function there's many things that those systems fail to capture about the world i'm interested in how.

106
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:14.370
Richard Carter: How they fail, but also how they can also be used to explore explore those aspects and make us think about them.

107
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:23.430
Richard Carter: So I mentioned a few projects and my paper waveform is one i've talked about a lot before it's actually drone poetry using machine vision.

108
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.440
Richard Carter: to pause ocean waves into a form of poetic text.

109
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:38.760
Richard Carter: Now the projects i'm working on is called orbital reveries and that involves landsat satellite images that are also parsed using machine vision into a form of text scheme.

110
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:47.460
Richard Carter: To using text and image to think about the limits and potentials of the sensory most of my paper is on my latest project called land form.

111
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.680
Richard Carter: So we have taught down landscapes, like you, kind of see on the PowerPoint here that are then turned into the circuit as visual algorithms.

112
00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:08.670
Richard Carter: That are then compiled as a form of esoteric programming language, which would then use to generate some json text arrays creative arrays of text so you might have an image like you see on the side of the screen here.

113
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.630
Richard Carter: And the system will then turn it to something looks a bit like this.

114
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:20.730
Richard Carter: Using to looking at the shifting brightness values of the image and then tracing it then I can instruction point on a visual Program.

115
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:31.170
Richard Carter: into the sort of diagram matic structures that you see, and these structures can then be executed, they can be read by an interpreter program to generate text structure.

116
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:42.750
Richard Carter: of the kind that you see on the right hand side of your screen here so effectively, then the landscapes, as they are enacted at the intersection of the sunlight camera lenses the actual sensors.

117
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:52.260
Richard Carter: And the script that kind of binds it all together, they are treated as constituting a structured schema that translates into specific compositions structure.

118
00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:04.680
Richard Carter: The result is selling a performance and acting a platform of sorts that's made up a very landscapes flying vehicles cameras web canvas graphics and text files.

119
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:13.620
Richard Carter: All doing things that are far removed from what they're typically used for and certainly working together in a combination that you don't usually see.

120
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:24.150
Richard Carter: So I want to stress here that the search is not for novelty in the abstract, or for definitive answers, or even to preordained what questions we might even ask, but to.

121
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:32.160
Richard Carter: bring together in an unpredictable unruly entanglement different systems to see what we might learn from them in the process.

122
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:40.710
Richard Carter: As usual, so failure and breakages and uncertainty is characteristic of this kind of undertaking and is often actually more interesting.

123
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:48.180
Richard Carter: And if everything just smoothly slots, together, we want things to break because we learn in the process, why they're breaking what might come out of it.

124
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:59.400
Richard Carter: For me, the kind of the breakage his failures that I found particularly instructive I found them presenting this work across different audiences in different forms, there is a problem of translation.

125
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:11.400
Richard Carter: Some people treat it as art, some people treated as research but he's difficult for them to see in both both sides at the same time there's often issues they when they want to interpret it one way or the other.

126
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:22.800
Richard Carter: there's a bit of an Ai problem as well, a lot of my work people wanted certainly members of the public want to treat it as a form of an Ai demonstrate demonstrate of Ai technology.

127
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:31.350
Richard Carter: And it isn't and I don't even think that quick Ai is all that interesting either, so I have to often preface what I do quite carefully say this is not Ai.

128
00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:42.480
Richard Carter: This is algorithmic but it's not quite the same thing and then certainly when i'm presenting my work in forums focused on environmental concerns environmental issues, there is a certain resistance.

129
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:50.040
Richard Carter: drones satellites databases do not come to mind so readily with thinking about ecological issues.

130
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:59.430
Richard Carter: i've often found that these systems are perceived actually is inimical to environmental concerns the digital as enough privilege, why should we have even more digital here.

131
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:12.000
Richard Carter: So I often have to frame, what I do quite carefully in those contexts as well to get us to think about what How can these systems that were embedded within in shaping our world, how can they also contribute.

132
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:24.300
Richard Carter: To getting us to think about these issues, one of the same time reworking the fact that they are premise on often quite problematic predicates in terms of their functioning and they uses and contemporary world.

133
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.710
Richard Carter: there's a long paper associated with all of this, so I don't want to take up any more of your time, but thank you all very much for listening.

134
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.020
Helen Burgess: Thank you, Richard.

135
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.610
Helen Burgess: Does a beautiful images.

136
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:51.540
Helen Burgess: Already finally up, we have Andrea could travel on a narrow graph ios i'm saying that correctly.

137
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.520
Andr?a Catr?pa: hi.

138
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.910
Andr?a Catr?pa: Can you see my screen.

139
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.500
Helen Burgess: yeah.

140
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.760
Helen Burgess: yeah, we can see okay.

141
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.020
Andr?a Catr?pa: Thank you, so I would like to thank the organization of yellow.

142
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:25.290
Andr?a Catr?pa: And the opportunity to be here to debate with colleagues as i'm a Brazilian in my mother tongue is Portuguese I won't try to improvise, so I will read the paragraph K.

143
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:49.560
Andr?a Catr?pa: So when they don't have phase and interactive do the work that proposes a reflection on the role of dreams in our lives created from a research initiated in 2020 during the cold coffee pandemic the work began with Internet searchers on a particular dream.

144
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:59.670
Andr?a Catr?pa: Subsequently, this creative process became an investigation into the atavistic relationships that the human species one things with dreams.

145
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:07.560
Andr?a Catr?pa: In observed the different meanings that this state of mind has acquired throughout our history, then.

146
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:25.560
Andr?a Catr?pa: In January of this year I invited the colder who's call it flipping madea need to work with me and then we work on wine for about three months to have the first version of on a geography, I will show you a video so you'll know how it looks like.

147
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.780
Andr?a Catr?pa: Sorry i'm just changing the screen to share oh sorry.

148
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.210
Andr?a Catr?pa: I didn't share the sound sorry.

149
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.000
Andr?a Catr?pa: yeah.

150
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:01.890
Andr?a Catr?pa: Now, I think, just to.

151
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:10.740
Helen Burgess: be here to present on a graph here a digital interactive work about the role of dreams in our lives.

152
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:22.680
after receiving a welcome message in the chosen language, a form will appear, you must fill in the blanks with some details about the dream, you want to remember, or to create.

153
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.230
It is time to choose between the door of the nightmare or the door of the dream.

154
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:18.720
Now we are at 3D environment where we can access the messenger Oracle, which is a Community report.

155
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:42.750
morpheus and a message streams from the icons and alive and by the current of guys.

156
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:50.850
If you follow the light spheres and click on the big I will be taken to the word search.

157
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:14.040
Jeremy Hight: Here you must choose exactly three words that are related to your dream.

158
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:35.100
Finally, you'll get an image with results and effects that are procedurally generated.

159
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:50.700
So the dream merges images chosen the word search and the phrases return order from there, it is at the user discretion to recreate an a dream randomly using the elements of that same navigation.

160
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.910
or going back to the beginning of the process to make other options for reports and word choices.

161
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.120
Andr?a Catr?pa: So that's it Thank you I will put the link, if you want to play.

162
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.310
Helen Burgess: Thank you very much, Andrea that's fascinating.

163
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.920
Helen Burgess: Alright, well, thank you all for keeping to your five minutes each.

164
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.630
Helen Burgess: much appreciated.

165
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.250
Helen Burgess: Before we start in on.

166
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:38.670
Helen Burgess: On questions, please just just drop an applause or reaction into your zoom so that screen, so we can all see the appreciation that we have for all our speakers today I know it's a tough.

167
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:46.230
Helen Burgess: Tough environment, thank you very much alrighty so.

168
00:27:48.720 --> 00:28:08.370
Helen Burgess: for Question Time if you'd like to ask a question and you'd like to ask yourself, you can drop a Q or a plus in the chat and if you'd prefer for me to ask it just you can direct message me or or just drop it in and we'll see what happens.

169
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:21.150
Helen Burgess: I do have a question to get us started if there aren't any other burning ones, right now, and that is about the way you all position your projects.

170
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:30.150
Helen Burgess: And this is this is something that I thought of when general go Korea, you were presenting and you talked about digital humanities and.

171
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:47.100
Helen Burgess: Digital literature and electronic literature and i'm just wondering if you've presented this project in other places, have you had to position it differently, for, say, a digital humanities audience, then you have for an electronic literature audience.

172
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.080
Shanmuga priya: Well, I have a.

173
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.330
Shanmuga priya: This is very first time in person thing about.

174
00:28:51.330 --> 00:29:01.020
Shanmuga priya: This project, and it was this digital poetry I just completed the first layer and second layer last week so yeah and be present in continuously.

175
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.000
Helen Burgess: Be there are.

176
00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.050
Are you hopeful.

177
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:19.530
Shanmuga priya: i'm hopeful I don't think there must be much issues, but maybe we'll have some critical questions when i'm learning computers and, in addition to a.

178
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.750
Shanmuga priya: conference in some.

179
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.160
Shanmuga priya: cases.

180
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.560
Shanmuga priya: I do, because.

181
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.540
Shanmuga priya: The aim of this district wide.

182
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.710
Shanmuga priya: impact with the students and.

183
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.640
Shanmuga priya: And because we are engaging NGOs.

184
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.920
Shanmuga priya: So there was.

185
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.600
Shanmuga priya: This.

186
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.030
Shanmuga priya: Like today.

187
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:52.380
Shanmuga priya: places we do hope it can create some impact them so again, but good luck and support escape.

188
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.270
Helen Burgess: Thank you.

189
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.140
Shanmuga priya: Thank you.

190
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.730
Richard Carter: known human being it's a.

191
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.220
Helen Burgess: All right, I think this might be a question for Richard as well, since you mentioned translation.

192
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.060
Helen Burgess: positioning your work yeah.

193
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.970
Richard Carter: So it is, it is very interesting and I think it depends I present my worked.

194
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.320
Richard Carter: Quite a few different.

195
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.900
Richard Carter: kinds of audience and.

196
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.940
Richard Carter: The nature of it lends itself well to.

197
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.620
Richard Carter: Public audiences because it.

198
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:45.270
Richard Carter: Has a strongly so creative aspect to people's name in contact with a lot of visual poets and artists who.

199
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.860
Helen Burgess: often do that.

200
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:55.500
Richard Carter: form it says, and certainly the issue of the Ai problem, as I call it is a big one in those contexts and a half now have to deliver.

201
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.080
Richard Carter: Something of a disclaimer at the start of every.

202
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:09.030
Richard Carter: presentation, this is not Ai in fact it's very much actually being quite critical of certain aspects that are driving Ai but what I I doesn't know what we even mean by.

203
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:16.200
Richard Carter: And that's quite important, as well, for when i'm talking to audiences and ecological forums, because.

204
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:22.410
Richard Carter: Even though many of them are very academic forums, there is still there still a sense that.

205
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:33.900
Richard Carter: Ai is the enemy, the paradigm of Ai is the enemy of the earth this this is this is part of a whole way of looking at the world arrests into matrices of command control.

206
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:43.350
Richard Carter: and absolute quantities of data and form and those things are seen as indeed inimical to the kinds of more subtle.

207
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:54.060
Richard Carter: embodied entanglements which many of them are much more concerned with exploring in their work which they do so through walking and dancing or poetry and performance.

208
00:31:54.510 --> 00:32:04.320
Richard Carter: And so I don't I can't say that I have a magical answer as to how one is supposed to reconcile those things, except to have to, I have to position my work really quite carefully.

209
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:15.510
Richard Carter: So it doesn't come across as a crass we look at these wonderful new fancy bits of technology, I put together on a wonderful arm a novel as if i'm pitching to a Silicon Valley audience.

210
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:24.840
Richard Carter: So there's a lot of there's quite a bit of can quite a bit of translation, that has to go in, but, as I mentioned at the very end, I think those those acts of translation.

211
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:31.050
Richard Carter: or they actually trying to translate them anyway, are really quite provocative, because it makes you understand.

212
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:40.440
Richard Carter: Your own work, a bit better makes you understand way what the field is that you're working in and, as I mentioned failures and break it is or okay.

213
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.250
Richard Carter: I don't want you know, some people just see what I do is bad art.

214
00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:53.100
Richard Carter: And that, in itself, we can be quite instructive as well for thinking about how we understand all these different topics, all these different aspects and so.

215
00:32:53.460 --> 00:33:01.050
Richard Carter: it's that it's those conversations those negotiations between different disciplines different discourses and different technologies.

216
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:11.280
Richard Carter: that's where that's where things in that's where the interest happens the actual assemblage itself may not be all that interesting is the catalyst for those conversations.

217
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.180
Richard Carter: that's my piece on it anyway.

218
00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.200
Richard Carter: Thank you.

219
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:35.100
Helen Burgess: Alright, we have a couple questions in the chat The first one is for Andrea and the question is Andre did you get inspiration from other navigable environments by Brazilian artists.

220
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.270
Andr?a Catr?pa: Actually, not.

221
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:44.550
Andr?a Catr?pa: I think that the 3D modeling came from phillippi.

222
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.420
Andr?a Catr?pa: Which is a coder that came from the Games world.

223
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:56.790
Andr?a Catr?pa: So I guess that's the thing I first inspiration, where the dream like.

224
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.620
Andr?a Catr?pa: narratives and then we try to put it in the 3D modeling.

225
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.680
Andr?a Catr?pa: In as he came from games, I think that he had some games.

226
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:23.790
Andr?a Catr?pa: Concerns like how you would clean can how you navigate and then we just melted all the things the narrative concerned that was mine in the this kind of game being that was his.

227
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.770
Helen Burgess: Thank you.

228
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.410
Helen Burgess: scrolling through the chat the next Q, I have here is from soren.

229
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.880
S?ren Bro Pold: yeah thanks.

230
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:55.050
S?ren Bro Pold: So I guess my question also follows up on what Richard just said and it's in that sentence it's a question to sort of send Luca and riches.

231
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.590
S?ren Bro Pold: pieces, mainly, which is, of course.

232
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:21.390
S?ren Bro Pold: yeah you Richard you address the the criticism towards technology Ai federal environmental areas and and and to to a lot of in a lot of ways that the right, you know we have this we have this even though the statistics are hard you know, the Internet and in cloud computing.

233
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:38.910
S?ren Bro Pold: Including what what we on now, even though it's probably better than flying for the environment it's it's still polluting quite a lot and they they say that you know, the Internet and computing etc is at the level of.

234
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.280
S?ren Bro Pold: offline.

235
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.970
S?ren Bro Pold: When when when when you count on the.

236
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.200
S?ren Bro Pold: Global the.

237
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.930
S?ren Bro Pold: yeah the pollution.

238
00:35:50.250 --> 00:36:01.110
S?ren Bro Pold: Carbon pollution so, so in that sense and and but but, of course, you know that's that's a that's been our question, or should we stop using computers, etc, but.

239
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:17.280
S?ren Bro Pold: I would say, the more interesting is whether you know, the way the functioning of these systems are these technologies these platforms is is somehow hiding the pollution for us or hiding.

240
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:26.700
S?ren Bro Pold: You know, you can see a car that pollutes but it's very difficult to see the pollution that soon causes right because it's it's having somewhere else.

241
00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.280
S?ren Bro Pold: And and and and this fact that you know when our netflix.

242
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:41.400
S?ren Bro Pold: as much energy as cooking appalling eight liters of water on you know where do you see that and whether whether you choose between.

243
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:55.770
S?ren Bro Pold: How could you even know as a consumer, that maybe apple streaming services are better than me some streaming services, and all this kind of stuff, and so my question is probably all my question is.

244
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:05.640
S?ren Bro Pold: I know how is it the sort of solution solution ISM you know the the fact that these technologies sort of is.

245
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:15.540
S?ren Bro Pold: click and then they work and know this sort of solution is mobile technology is that the problem and it's that also where you can see your art.

246
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.270
S?ren Bro Pold: You know, you also spoke.

247
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.770
S?ren Bro Pold: To talk about disruption, or what cannot really do in this field.

248
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:32.940
Richard Carter: Show.

249
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.130
So she wishes to.

250
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.270
Shanmuga priya: Thank you for the question.

251
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:49.230
Shanmuga priya: Oh, I think, as like in every other field there are there is there is always like both sides like negative and positive sides.

252
00:37:49.500 --> 00:38:01.890
Shanmuga priya: But absolutely can and be like, if you look at the positive side it's much more higher than the negative side, because in this pandemic, well, it is delicious helping us like walking or reaching more people and other maybe talking piece.

253
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:14.760
Shanmuga priya: That is actually I feel is right ghosting so I can i'm just feeling a comparison here avoids not much travel to the electronic age show from my experience.

254
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:26.700
Shanmuga priya: These the few decades before our tap water is huge and people really liked it and they welcome and every quarter and go and everything but.

255
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:33.810
Shanmuga priya: it's like because our mobile they started using technology to extract the water more.

256
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:42.450
Shanmuga priya: than earlier but laughter now we are realizing that how miss that opportunity other side, like we are just forgotten our.

257
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:56.340
Shanmuga priya: water bodies like tanks and channel strange because we are focusing on the it's taking water from the at, so in that case i'm so everything the negative side, we will release on the latter not.

258
00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:08.640
Shanmuga priya: not know, in that case, how can we use odd sm as a medium to connect with people recording the shoes um.

259
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:20.130
Shanmuga priya: It can go more impact than we imagined it so far from my experience, so I actually did a couple of presentations not exactly a booster party that it created, but just in general.

260
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:36.210
Shanmuga priya: So that shows that people are like very much interested to see Mr pine tree and they like know if they can feel the connection between the Easter party that will create impact about the positions and so.

261
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.970
Shanmuga priya: I learned on an ongoing basis.

262
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.610
Shanmuga priya: that's my answer.

263
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.230
Richard Carter: Just follow that very, very briefly, I think you know, I think it is a very interesting question and yeah there's.

264
00:39:49.590 --> 00:40:04.080
Richard Carter: Times, the answer is well this is to stop using computers and somehow things are going to be better and, of course, well, maybe that's not quite what's going to be the case, the way I often characterize my art and these conversations is is partly through.

265
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:15.870
Richard Carter: i've used the term resistance before and i'm not sure if that were carries too much baggage what i'm trying to do, because it's used in very particular context, particular ways, but nevertheless.

266
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:33.180
Richard Carter: I think this idea has been spoken up by various theories, the idea around things like glitch aesthetics, the idea of breakdowns and technologies, making us realize their how they function, how they operate, and indeed to get away from this smoothly functional solution ISM.

267
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:41.400
Richard Carter: there's always an APP for that there's always a beautiful flowing interface that delivers to us the world in a nice clean neat packaged form.

268
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:50.430
Richard Carter: And went allergies fail or break down or indeed you produce works, where it's doing very, very strange things makes you think about.

269
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.430
Richard Carter: The technicality of it, it makes you think about how it functions and makes you realize it's an artifact in the world.

270
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:06.330
Richard Carter: Now of course i've always been quite frank, I don't believe my art, as some are going to be to save the world or contribute to that I take a lot of them.

271
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:16.200
Richard Carter: As a lot of inspiration from the climate scientists to Kate marvel who she who says that courage is the resolve to do well without the red ones, have a happy ending.

272
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:31.860
Richard Carter: And I really like that the idea that we do things not believe it's going to necessarily save the world and terrible ruin, but nevertheless we don't give up on it, because every act every step every conversation every stage matters.

273
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:43.770
Richard Carter: And that's how I tend to think about what my work is doing if it's doing anything is to try to encourage those conversations different ways of looking at technology sensors and data.

274
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:58.020
Richard Carter: Not just what they are before what they might become what the world might become, irrespective of whether that's going to lead automatically to a wondrous future well that's so that's a bigger conversation but it's part of that.

275
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:20.250
Helen Burgess: Alright, I see a couple more questions in the chat first we have, mark you had a question about ISA.

276
00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.140
Helen Burgess: Mark can you there.

277
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.970
i'll just read it right.

278
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.520
Mark Marino: Here sorry.

279
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.690
Helen Burgess: Oh go ahead.

280
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.340
Mark Marino: I was, I thought my next question would do its work hey look here him.

281
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.130
Mark Marino: Richard can you just talk a little bit more about that as the esoteric language that you felt.

282
00:42:55.170 --> 00:43:05.280
Richard Carter: Absolutely, I mean I don't I don't make any big claims that it's that is most wondrous vesa Latins you've ever seen or it's doing something, especially exotic it as he saw lang's go.

283
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:15.030
Richard Carter: But the idea, there were certain ideas, taken from that you know period which one we're all quite sort of quite familiar with, probably in that world.

284
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:26.760
Richard Carter: The idea of using a visual trace across colored blocks to draw your funny instruction pointer and what I was doing slight variation of that but.

285
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:42.600
Richard Carter: Without rambling on and on and on the system instead of it goes through each block of the image and it registers, the shift of brightness values and continue contiguous brightens blocks and he uses them.

286
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:53.970
Richard Carter: as vectors for whether the instruction pointer changes direction, and to what extent it keeps on going forward before it then rotates through again and.

287
00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:04.140
Richard Carter: There are a couple of strengths there i've met yesterday called revisit the same place it's already gone to so that's where you get this sort of looping labyrinth fine look.

288
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:16.770
Richard Carter: And what happens is the system, then reads the directions of the various vectors taken by the instruction pointer, I guess, ultimately, and then uses that to decide.

289
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:29.370
Richard Carter: For which lexicon it's going to draw a set of words, is it going to an SP arrays are going to keep on tracing through an array of associate words or you're just going to spit out a long block.

290
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:39.840
Richard Carter: And in simple terms that's how it composes The end result, effectively, so I can't say it's say it's nothing that sophisticated.

291
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.240
Richard Carter: But nevertheless, it was as good is a good away as I could to create an interesting combination.

292
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:53.160
Richard Carter: Of outputs and also to make the code itself would you something looks quite interesting i'm interested in diagrams and how we tried to arrest the world.

293
00:44:53.430 --> 00:45:00.150
Richard Carter: makes sense of the world diet grammatically and its relationship to digital systems and how they function as well.

294
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:10.620
Richard Carter: I can go on and on and on there's there are there is thought here on this me throwing things at the wall and seeing what stick but, but that is that's the basics of how the system works.

295
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.020
Mark Marino: it's fantastic, thank you very much appreciate it.

296
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.830
Helen Burgess: All right, we have a question from alessia for Andrea.

297
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:34.290
Alessia Pannese: Yes, thank you good afternoon everyone i'm Andrea I liked very much your presentation and I was wondering whether an element of the went into the development of this.

298
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:40.800
Alessia Pannese: dream nightmare landscape might be the.

299
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:47.310
Alessia Pannese: ensemble of dream theories so including.

300
00:45:48.990 --> 00:46:16.740
Alessia Pannese: cognitive theories of dreams, we can go back to Roy but also from the physiological perspective, for example, there are many theories on what the survival value of dreaming might be so how my tuning have evolved to be an essential part, we know from, for example, my mind's experiment that.

301
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:33.090
Alessia Pannese: Preventing an animal from sleeping is not as legal or illegal in in such a short time range then preventing an animal from dreaming.

302
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:45.000
Alessia Pannese: So if you let an animal sleep but wait, the more up every time the animal starts dreaming, and of course there are ways of knowing that to electoral and circle griffey.

303
00:46:45.750 --> 00:47:00.000
Alessia Pannese: Then the animal dies in the matter of 48 hours or I don't remember exactly the data, but much, much shorter time range them just depriving it from sleeping itself so.

304
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.070
Alessia Pannese: wanna Thank you.

305
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:17.550
Andr?a Catr?pa: Thank you alyssa and, yes, I was studying the dream theory, since the last year, because I had a very strange dream just in the beginning of the pandemics, it was a nice dream, but very strange.

306
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:35.460
Andr?a Catr?pa: And I was really obsessive about it, so I started to to research on that particular dream, then, but then I started to think about how that dream made me survive during the pandemics.

307
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:45.870
Andr?a Catr?pa: Because I started to read a lot of things I started to research and then, I guess, I felt a little bit happier.

308
00:47:47.040 --> 00:48:05.760
Andr?a Catr?pa: In wanting to move on, but then I started to focus more on the this kind of procedures of dreams, I wrote an article last year in I had some some some things to to.

309
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.070
Andr?a Catr?pa: to reflect about some theories, I have read about.

310
00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:20.670
Andr?a Catr?pa: psychology but also about neuroscience and then disease I started to research on the.

311
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:35.970
Andr?a Catr?pa: The role of dreams for indigenous people, so I will right now and other article with this research, I guess, more profound.

312
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:48.630
Andr?a Catr?pa: I guess, I will write it next month, maybe, but in this presentation I focus on the environment, but it has this kind of research behind.

313
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:50.790
Alessia Pannese: Thank you.

314
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:56.910
Richard Carter: Just you just very quickly add.

315
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:00.060
Richard Carter: Add to that I think that's really interesting I found your peace and.

316
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:10.980
Richard Carter: dre are really interesting to think about when you because you've alluded to in your paper about the role that dreams, have played for people to try to make sense of their environment so i'm often.

317
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:20.970
Richard Carter: When I think about some sense, making through the ages, I tend to think about actually to cave walls 10s of thousands of years ago when they were drawing animals in their hands.

318
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:28.680
Richard Carter: On the surface and the way we've tried to make it why we try to understand what were those activities meant and often that the.

319
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:36.720
Richard Carter: notion of dreams has come up quite frequently in the discussions of people studying that work, and so I think there's actually an awful lot.

320
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:48.390
Richard Carter: there's a lot going on there, and your piece and making us think about how we use dreams, to make sense of just what it means to be and, certainly, what does it mean to be alive in the teeth of a pandemic.

321
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:54.060
Richard Carter: has a certain very strong poignancy so I really look forward to the article that sounds fascinating.

322
00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:02.010
Andr?a Catr?pa: Thank you, Richard yes in my mother she used to tell me about her dreams.

323
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:19.440
Andr?a Catr?pa: Every day in, then I kind of pay attention to my dreams and then I started to research on some theories that say that this is really important, and we should create a kind of dream airy.

324
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:36.750
Andr?a Catr?pa: So we should take notes of our dreams to think about what they are saying to us, not in a kind of mystical term, but in a very practical way is something that you tell into yourself so that's it.

325
00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:45.660
Helen Burgess: Thank you all.

326
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:55.140
Helen Burgess: I think we still have another 15 minutes or so for questions but mark has also reminded me that if you want to continue the discussion.

327
00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:13.050
Helen Burgess: You can do so on discord in the track three channel I haven't been keeping up with this code, but presumably This makes sense to you, so do feel free to do that do we have any questions from the panelists for each other, I know you were asked to prepare something possibly.

328
00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:26.160
Shanmuga priya: Though I don't have any questions, but I really admired by others, was that that was.

329
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.570
Shanmuga priya: really wonderful and very.

330
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.760
Shanmuga priya: very much appreciated and fantastic.

331
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.740
Shanmuga priya: Thank you, thank you for sharing this.

332
00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.120
Richard Carter: Oh definitely second that.

333
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.140
Shanmuga priya: One absolutely I.

334
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.520
Richard Carter: Think, I think the thing that.

335
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:52.590
Richard Carter: When i'm speaking a lot, so I should keep this quick but we've got some very different different approaches to this question, I think, and that Variety is really interesting trying to draw connections between them is, we have an unusually broad array.

336
00:51:53.670 --> 00:52:01.110
Richard Carter: of different set of difference of platforms and structures that we're putting together for different ends, I thought that's a dialogue with sort of really interesting.

337
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:13.260
Richard Carter: I was just trying to think actually as well for the for the for us our team working on some improvised media, there was a question I was thinking about asking them actually so Peter and what have you.

338
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:22.890
Richard Carter: One of the things I saw when it comes to performance during the pandemic and way performance responded, I mean I certainly saw modes that talks about.

339
00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:34.740
Richard Carter: Using vr so some people were doing there yeah she just shifted their performance hopefully to a vr environment, and that was obviously useful as a certain audiences, but not others, and then there were other.

340
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:44.580
Richard Carter: Performers who just simply went over to just doing a podcast they just they didn't actually weren't present physically, they just read the lines and did them as a radio play.

341
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:51.810
Richard Carter: So, I guess, I mean those seem to be the most common responses that I saw so forgive me if this sounds like quite a.

342
00:52:52.500 --> 00:53:01.020
Richard Carter: silly question but i'm quite interested what made you think wouldn't it be good if we could somehow create these telepresence performances in zoom, what do you think.

343
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:09.840
Richard Carter: is really brought to the table there for doing this kind of performance, what do you think's the real crux of the real benefits of this kind of arrangement.

344
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:17.640
Improv Media & Performance Lab: For, thank you for the question, the first part of it is you know I do it and I guess for me it's because all the other experiences are terrible.

345
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:21.720
Richard Carter: In an.

346
00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:29.550
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Online performance is painful and it is largely an exercise and.

347
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:49.860
Improv Media & Performance Lab: I don't know sort of search or ask no exit approach to you know, trying to make meaning and connect with others, nevertheless we're very much embedded already embroiled and inherent need and desire to connect, and so we work with the means that we have.

348
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:53.910
Improv Media & Performance Lab: And i'm being sort of cheeky in that response but.

349
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.240
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Ultimately, you know.

350
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:06.450
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Before the pandemic technology has been already always embedded in the way that we connect with each other.

351
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:15.090
Improv Media & Performance Lab: The opportunity to have a deprivation of our normal modes of communication became something exciting for PR and I and corey.

352
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:26.370
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Where since we're already kind of thinking about how language and communication and in our in our in our practice improvisational theater is affected by technology.

353
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:35.820
Improv Media & Performance Lab: gave us an opportunity to really dive fully in, and this is where we started to kind of parse out well, what are the specific aspects of.

354
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:47.160
Improv Media & Performance Lab: of performance that are vital to sort of embodied ness and and being present with each other and what can be parsed but can be dissected into you know the.

355
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:54.960
Improv Media & Performance Lab: The binary of of a digital communication, one of the things that that kept on emerging was the sense of presence itself.

356
00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:08.400
Improv Media & Performance Lab: And so the system we developed was not so much a desire or expectation that we could like fix the problem of performing so much as an opportunity to explore the nature of presence.

357
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:16.680
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Which inherently requires accessibility, so you ask this question about vr and of course sure that that's great if you have a headset.

358
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:24.120
Improv Media & Performance Lab: Even more important that's great if you'd have in the gaming computer that can actually process graphics at speed, where you can have an experience.

359
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.620
Improv Media & Performance Lab: If you've spent any time in these spaces, you know that's a very tiny.

360
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:38.190
Improv Media & Performance Lab: tiny amount of people it's not accessible it's like a dream, you know the nightmares and dreams, if you want to look for a connection, I think the dream of what technology can offer is very much.

361
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:46.350
Improv Media & Performance Lab: answered and how much effort we spend and the utopia of what could be so we wanted to build a platform that could be now, and that is.

362
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:56.730
Improv Media & Performance Lab: we're all looking at screens all the time, can we do something about the way we fell President with each other, you know i'm i'm talking to myself right, and I see myself in this box, I see you in boxes.

363
00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:05.130
Improv Media & Performance Lab: And sort of with you, but to be honest i'm very much not i'm very like i'm striving spending so much cognitive effort to stay with you right now.

364
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:18.390
Improv Media & Performance Lab: One of the aspects of that is the environment itself the aesthetics, of how we conduct we're biologically trained to survey information in a certain way.

365
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:30.030
Improv Media & Performance Lab: And so, our platform kind of emerged as the desire to see well, how can we strip away the extraneous the boxes and see what happens in emerges when we bring each other together in a visual co located space.

366
00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:34.440
Thank you very much.

367
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:41.760
Piotr (he/him) London: And if I could add to what boyd mentioned.

368
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:51.150
Piotr (he/him) London: I believe that one of the fundamental philosophy in our approach is to take a symbiotic relationship with technology, rather than.

369
00:56:52.170 --> 00:57:04.440
Piotr (he/him) London: go with the easy route of adversarial exposure so Richard alluded to, that a little bit so we started in robotics five years ago as doing improv with robots.

370
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:18.030
Piotr (he/him) London: and very quickly the improv Community picked on picked on the idea that it was not a replacement, it was basically a new tool for actors to help them to.

371
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:28.170
Piotr (he/him) London: focus on certain aspects of the performance, not to have to think, for instance, and not to deploy cognitive load about storytelling.

372
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:38.280
Piotr (he/him) London: If you go to watch interrupt shows, especially long form narrative improv shows you notice that sometimes people are limited in the head, because we try to make sense of the plot what's coming after.

373
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:50.700
Piotr (he/him) London: Here there is a chatbot that sends lines that sometimes do not make sense to the ears of improvisers well that's what the text says it's like reading Beckett.

374
00:57:51.240 --> 00:58:06.690
Piotr (he/him) London: It was intended so i'm going to deliver it as if I believed it and his if I understood my relationship to the text message to the rest of the cast on stage and to be audience, and so we use this.

375
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:23.760
Piotr (he/him) London: This to have Ai chatbots as essentially a sort of implementation or a challenge, depending on what perspective, you take that it has been quite embraced by the Community we've been touring and performing with wearables and chat bots.

376
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:34.380
Piotr (he/him) London: And another aspect that very quickly was introduced was when I started collaborating this project with corey Matthews and he was an edmonton I live in London well.

377
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:44.760
Piotr (he/him) London: There is Google meet what else, so we, I actually would walk on stage with a laptop connected for protector, he will be on stage there'll be a live audience.

378
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:52.380
Piotr (he/him) London: And we even that shows have to live audiences in two different theaters creating that connection and using the technology, which is so frail.

379
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:54.000
Piotr (he/him) London: and

380
00:58:55.350 --> 00:59:05.040
Piotr (he/him) London: Create and basically enabling a new sort of form of communication, that would not be normally allowed in the physically bounce theater space.

381
00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:25.980
Piotr (he/him) London: So we combine this idea of communication over borders and now over different languages with trying to immerse ourselves in an environment that recreate the sense of presence and proximity in a virtual way and and you build on that.

382
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:36.690
Helen Burgess: I see Leo has his hand up Leo do did you mean to have your hand up you did.

383
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:46.770
Leonardo Flores: I did I did, I just wanted to congratulate all the panelists on on the great work you're doing and and I do have a brief comment and a question.

384
00:59:47.610 --> 01:00:00.240
Leonardo Flores: So i'm very I kathryn and I were were back channel chatting about you know how how like a platform like vr would be very well suited for the kind of immersive experience of the sort of dream like.

385
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:18.240
Leonardo Flores: event events and, of course, she and I very quickly got to the problem that was just alluded to have have access right and and and i'm thinking part of the solution, I mean I got my my first vr headset yesterday.

386
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:24.570
Leonardo Flores: I haven't I haven't like turned it on yet I I need to get through this conference first.

387
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:32.250
Leonardo Flores: i'm afraid to go down that rabbit hole but but i've done phone based vr right and i'm thinking that might be.

388
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:46.080
Leonardo Flores: One way right things like Google cardboard so so having that sort of premier vr experience, but then also the the sort of more vr video experience that becomes more.

389
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:56.460
Leonardo Flores: accessible, so I just wanted to touch on that as a possibility for expanding audience now speaking of audience and and theater.

390
01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:09.570
Leonardo Flores: One of the things i'm fascinated by his his Twitter bots and interacting with them, I I see zach waylon a fellow Twitter Bot scholar and enthusiast and creator here.

391
01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:20.340
Leonardo Flores: You know, we usually interact with them and encounter them and in spaces like Twitter and or standalone chat bots and things like that.

392
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:34.410
Leonardo Flores: I really love what the what the improv team is doing by bringing them onto the stage, because I mean this so here here what i'm thinking about is is how.

393
01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:45.120
Leonardo Flores: X, but what are the challenges we have with generative work is, that is, that is, all the all that sort of cognitive wrapping your brain around.

394
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:55.860
Leonardo Flores: What it is that someone is experiencing right whether it's narrative right or it becomes a theater of the absurd in which there's these non sequiturs right.

395
01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:08.550
Leonardo Flores: And, and still we're trying to wrap our brain around it, and these things work well with short bits I think that's why one of the reasons Twitter bots are so successful you get this little shot.

396
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:17.700
Leonardo Flores: That you can kind of wrap your brain around it, but, but the challenge and so i'd love to hear you all speak about some of the challenge.

397
01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:28.230
Leonardo Flores: of doing that, over the course of a performance right so that's that's one of the the tricks How long are people willing to to go right.

398
01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:48.750
Leonardo Flores: I think if they know it's pure bought they may become a little more impatient and my experience, people are willing to to give human created work longer attention and harder work because they expect that there is a reason and a meaning behind it.

399
01:02:49.830 --> 01:03:03.420
Leonardo Flores: With box they're like oh that's an algorithm or whatever right and that may not go as far but, but so so I love to hear you all, you know share your impressions on that, but also.

400
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:24.480
Leonardo Flores: The very aspect of personification that we have with bots right personification or I mean even concepts right, even if they're not trying to pass as people a lot of these box accounts are an embodying a concept right and so that is the.

401
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:38.100
Leonardo Flores: That is the the so now here you have actors hearing bought deliver delivering bought created generated lines so so.

402
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:50.520
Leonardo Flores: So i'd love to hear you both here you all kind of talk about that the personification aspect, and also the the the attention the conceptual.

403
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:53.190
Leonardo Flores: You know.

404
01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.890
Leonardo Flores: How that fits into that sort of long game of your performances.

405
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:13.410
Piotr (he/him) London: I think I would like to start with a note on how quickly technology has evolved in the last.

406
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.100
Piotr (he/him) London: i'd say five years when we started working with this.

407
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.400
Piotr (he/him) London: Initially we use so called recurrent neural networks which are pretty good at generating.

408
01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:34.350
Piotr (he/him) London: sequences and for fairly similar to be in principle to market chains, which had already been explode even violent cheering.

409
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:37.920
Piotr (he/him) London: include Shannon.

410
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:46.080
Piotr (he/him) London: In the 50s there was even a reference to close shannon's work in keep johnson's book and in pro.

411
01:04:48.240 --> 01:05:01.710
Piotr (he/him) London: The reference was quite dismissive because the MAC of changes generating essentially sentences that vaguely made sense in isolation that didn't make sense in the rest, so when the project started it did.

412
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:11.280
Piotr (he/him) London: require a significant amount of work from the performers to to basically justify whatever was coming, and it was.

413
01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:17.880
Piotr (he/him) London: Essentially, adding to be cognitive load so to negate completely the point I made earlier.

414
01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.880
Piotr (he/him) London: It was simplifying the cognitive load of a person delivering tonight's about augmenting.

415
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.390
Piotr (he/him) London: The cognitive load of all the team around.

416
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:41.280
Piotr (he/him) London: But of course we justified it as a sort of educational tool for improvisers, how do you improvise with a shoe how the improvise with a random audience Member.

417
01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:44.670
Piotr (he/him) London: Who, we never did improv before.

418
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:51.630
Piotr (he/him) London: And we devised a whole series of tricks.

419
01:05:53.340 --> 01:06:01.500
Piotr (he/him) London: which were very well correlated with acting techniques which is to establish connections on an emotional level.

420
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:06.210
Piotr (he/him) London: Have underlying.

421
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:16.740
Piotr (he/him) London: super objectives in the same way, our standard slutsky actors are guided by by by objectives when they deliver lines.

422
01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:28.980
Piotr (he/him) London: For technology evolved so quite soon we switched to using transformers architecture which have essentially they sort of tape.

423
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:38.250
Piotr (he/him) London: But it can be seen as a canvas or as a as a notepad for about stores they recent past, have a conversation.

424
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:56.700
Piotr (he/him) London: And the neural network keeps referring to that tape over and over when it generates text, which means that if you introduce a character if you don't use the location, the no network will basically refer to it, and it will even copy the misspellings it will copy the specific.

425
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.690
Piotr (he/him) London: uppercase and lowercase of each word.

426
01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.020
Piotr (he/him) London: And that already.

427
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:15.720
Piotr (he/him) London: helps a lot in the sense about the, even though the chat Bot cannot keep a stance.

428
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:22.410
Piotr (he/him) London: It can still refer to the past and reincorporate elements for us and that simplifies little bit.

429
01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:33.900
Piotr (he/him) London: But the one thing that really made it work was not to use the top choice of a chat Bot, it was to basically reintroduce human curation individual.

430
01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.090
Piotr (he/him) London: and

431
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:52.140
Piotr (he/him) London: And that's how we made this from a tool that try to display agency into a tool use for creativity for human creativity.

432
01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:59.700
Piotr (he/him) London: So what happens is that for every context every suggestion given by the performer but the other performer.

433
01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:09.060
Piotr (he/him) London: We type it in, or we there is a specific mission going in and then the child comes with multiple choices and there is a human envelope who selects.

434
01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:25.830
Piotr (he/him) London: What fits best so versus human judgment and the human evaluation, which probably won't be replaced, even though we reached general artificial intelligence, because this is something that is very specific to the human experience and has nothing to do with intelligence percent.

435
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:35.850
Piotr (he/him) London: So that human enables essentially to curate the answers in the way that that makes sense and justifies well what's going on the stage.

436
01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:48.660
Piotr (he/him) London: And that goes with this even further was idea of of art living in some users with a human with him creativity with technology getting interviews us with human creativity.

437
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:13.140
Helen Burgess: So it looks like we have five minutes in the in the interest of them starting to wrap up here and keep on time, I have a question for Chicago priya.

438
01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:22.800
Helen Burgess: Which is about choices so and I think this follows up from layers question about how to frame art in some ways.

439
01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:28.920
Helen Burgess: And I know you're just beginning this project right it's kind of actively in development.

440
01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:37.470
Helen Burgess: So i'm wondering i'm a restoration and so rhetoricians are really interested in the consciousness of the choices that you have to make.

441
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:52.770
Helen Burgess: While you're making something or building something or saying something so i'm wondering what what kinds of choices are you making right now, while you build your project, and how are they constrained by the resources that you have or.

442
01:09:53.970 --> 01:10:01.650
Helen Burgess: How are they improved by the excesses that you have to materials that you have access to.

443
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:18.000
Shanmuga priya: Okay, thank you, thank you for the question actually I was thinking about the access then Leonardo like emphasized about the access problem so initially I was also thinking work on word being artificial piping to be on board but.

444
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:24.900
Shanmuga priya: Then I like it, then I realized the challenge, because I have to buy that PR setup and.

445
01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:35.700
Shanmuga priya: Actually, the basic or project, I have to go to schools and conduct this visual poetry and collect the feedback, but this pandemic is changed everything so, then I was.

446
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:50.010
Shanmuga priya: A little like I was like little happy because this pandemic also made sure that number one is necessary, regardless of any school students and starting from the like Hello great to hire.

447
01:10:50.430 --> 01:11:04.380
Shanmuga priya: So in that way now, I have no more more like chances to share the digital apply to everyone to school students and college students, so they can watch it and you them give the feedback to me.

448
01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:26.820
Shanmuga priya: But again, if I want to introduce I can be, I feel that that is little more challenge, because not all the students are like capable of using the android for which is the future to run the via PayPal work so, then that is the challenge and I if I asked the material restrictions um.

449
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:36.660
Shanmuga priya: I do not have any material constraints and our limitations, because I can access to the maps that are digitized by lucky.

450
01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:46.020
Shanmuga priya: This project or just sponsoring partner tracing maps, so that I got it so earlier when I start developing GEO referenced maps of what.

451
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:52.050
Shanmuga priya: The historical maps and current satellite imagery so that work is done and then after.

452
01:11:52.620 --> 01:12:04.440
Shanmuga priya: Like when the pandemic is little bit down, I mean the situation was mature, but the earlier few months before then, I did my field visits and collected for both, and I have large enough for us.

453
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:14.430
Shanmuga priya: So, to create for donation so somehow I managed to do on these blocks before the retreat this much now currently in India, so now, I can.

454
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:30.660
Shanmuga priya: Then other all of this office hours are available free, whatever the software and using so that now, though many work is like how to reach the students and college people learned other NGO people and bubbling that that is actually a little challenge.

455
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.680
Shanmuga priya: In this current situation but let's go.

456
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:40.920
Helen Burgess: Thank you.

457
01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.590
Helen Burgess: Alright, well, we are coming up on.

458
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:54.240
Helen Burgess: My time 943 so unless anyone has a really quick final question.

459
01:12:55.530 --> 01:13:04.080
Helen Burgess: Maybe we should start wrapping up here and mark reminded me to continue discussing your work on this Court.

460
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:24.810
Helen Burgess: As we go through the day or the end of the day, depending on where you are, thank you very much to our panelists and thank you Scott and sorry for providing this platform for us to all chat feel free to unmute wave your arms around say congratulations pop up a.

461
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:28.830
Helen Burgess: reaction to all our panelists.

462
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:46.710
Richard Carter: Thank you very much, everyone that was a really interesting discussion, and then they Thank you to all the panelists you do doing some really amazing work and it's really lovely to see, so thank you for sharing it with us.

463
01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:49.680
Helen Burgess: absolutely agree.

464
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:55.470
Helen Burgess: Already on to the next one.
