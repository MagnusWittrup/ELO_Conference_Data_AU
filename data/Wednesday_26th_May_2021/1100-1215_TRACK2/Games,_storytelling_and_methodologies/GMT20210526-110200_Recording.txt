00:24:51	Deena Larsen:	Hannah did an amazing job of workshop coordinator!
00:27:24	Deena Larsen:	Scalar is a open source, web-based publishing software from the University of Southern California's Alliance for Networking Visual Culture that allows you to create networked, multi-media online publications.
00:27:38	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Pathfinders is an awesome project
00:31:42	Deena Larsen:	Love the idea of a single strand vs multi strand story
00:35:30	Deena Larsen:	Even Cowgirls bleed https://scoutshonour.com/cowgirl/
00:50:04	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	That approach is absolutely necessary and opens new creative ways to explore
00:55:40	Deena Larsen:	Hannah and  Rob and Maria—how do you see these platforms and born digital ideas in general helping authors tell their life stories—what is one major “help” for readers in these technologies that is not present with pen and paper?
00:55:54	Deena Larsen:	Hannah, could you go back with some background: How do Pathfinder authors use Scalar, What advantages did users find with this? Can you provide some Pathfinder URLs?
00:56:59	Deena Larsen:	How do you see access for writing as a barrier?  Your works span a range from “easy” (Maria’s work” to production difficult with Wallace and Grommet.
00:58:43	Deena Larsen:	The public and youtube traversals have allowed everyone to follow that reading and get a sense of the lost work
00:59:31	Christine Wilks:	Maria - How do the Colombian women feel about their stories being available on the web platform? Did you/they anonymise them?
01:00:25	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	https://scalar.usc.edu/works/pathfinders/index.versions
01:12:06	Deena Larsen:	Mobile phones are the access point--particularly for India, countries in Africa, etc. where no one has a computer but everyone has a mobile phone.
01:12:30	Deena Larsen:	So developing an app has barriers
01:13:11	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Thats true, like Eugenio Tisselli project Sauti Ya Wakulima
01:14:05	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	http://sautiyawakulima.net/bagamoyo/about.php?l=1
01:14:17	Christine Wilks:	Mobile is also a very accessible platform for branching text-based stories, hypertexts, etc.
01:15:22	Deena Larsen:	I think Covid has created a new world audience as people are used to zoom and video for communication now
01:17:08	Deena Larsen:	This really does bring out the intensely personal writing space to the intensely public space (Scalar)
01:18:51	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	This is a great resource for co-creation practices
01:18:53	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	https://cocreationstudio.mit.edu/
01:20:44	Deena Larsen:	Thanks Andrew!
01:20:54	Maria Mencia:	Thank you Andrew
01:22:10	Deena Larsen:	Let's play also allows people with disabilities to actually play the game...
01:26:06	Deena Larsen:	There is definintely an economy of platformization--let's play etc.
01:26:26	Deena Larsen:	The more eyes you get on your platform, the more valuable it becomes economically
01:26:46	Deena Larsen:	It is great to see multistrandedness becoming mainstream!
01:26:55	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Rob, can you write those theorists names in the chat
01:28:33	Deena Larsen:	I love the blurring of the boundaries between personal and commercial, between academic and life
01:32:29	Rob Gallagher:	It’s Scott Lash & Celia Lury who write about Wallace & Gromit in Global Culture Industry
01:33:16	Deena Larsen:	video ethics and electronic lit ethics are merging...
01:33:54	Deena Larsen:	MAria can you put the URL for your Life Stories in the chat
01:34:33	Maria Mencia:	Deena they are at the beginning but here you are and Invisible voices: https://www.voces-invisibles.com/
01:38:56	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Thank you all, this was great!!
01:39:03	Oreto Doménech i Masià:	Thank you, it was very interesting!
01:39:06	Roberta Iadevaia:	Thank you all ^^
