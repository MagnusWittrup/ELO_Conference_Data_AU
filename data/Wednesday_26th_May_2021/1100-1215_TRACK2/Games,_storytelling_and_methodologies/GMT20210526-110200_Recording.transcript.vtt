00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:00.450
susiecronin: know.

2
00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.680
susiecronin: we'll continue with the recording if that's Okay, and for those of you who haven't met me before my name is susie cronin.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:18.060
susiecronin: And the content of our panel today the title is game storytelling and methodologies and will follow the order of the program so first off we have Hannah documents.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:29.280
susiecronin: And hannah's presentation is entitled follow the pathfinders a case study approach to production, use and readership on scale so we're looking forward to hearing from you Hannah.

5
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.510
Hannah Ackermans: Thank you very much i'll put the link right now.

6
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:48.120
Hannah Ackermans: And I should start by apologizing, you will get like fancy powerpoints and presentations and videos later, but I had to run the last two days, so I prioritize them, so I will just be talking to you instead.

7
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.740
Hannah Ackermans: that's like minutes.

8
00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:03.570
Hannah Ackermans: So effect as scholars and artists and electronic literature, we have a soft spot for media specific analysis, a term coined by m catrin hales for interrogating the math reality of literary hypertext.

9
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.990
Hannah Ackermans: But hypertext and other born digital modes of narratives are no longer just a research subject there also our means of communication and publication.

10
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.590
Hannah Ackermans: There have been various born digital journals and platforms that encourage scholars to use multi modal means of academic publication, each with their own media specificity.

11
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.330
Hannah Ackermans: So i've done a deep dive into that by now canonical book pathfinders documenting the experience of early digital literature.

12
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:42.480
Hannah Ackermans: In pathfinders third multiple degree our document for classic works of electronic bits are using a combination of films, books books by authors and readers known as reversals.

13
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:56.850
Hannah Ackermans: Along with films interviews and carefully described and photographed physical materials as such pathfinders is positioned as a dh practice to rescue early works of electronic literature, both from a technological obsolescence and from Michigan.

14
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:08.910
Hannah Ackermans: So what I wanted to know is how the platform of ordinances influence the production and circulation of the book and the best way to research that's fine there as well as, of course, by hosting some professionals with my own.

15
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:20.400
Hannah Ackermans: On zoom I interviewed unique regard about the process of creating pathfinders and I had three readers with various degrees of experience with electronic literature read this book, for the first time.

16
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:36.510
Hannah Ackermans: Now I couldn't possibly go through all of my results in these few minutes, but what I found was that the media specificity was deeply tied to production and use of the Platform, the institutional embedding the technological ecology and the promotion of research values.

17
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:47.760
Hannah Ackermans: So rather than an isolation of the media text itself, my contextual approach allows me to reflect on the media specificity as implemented within the media and academic network.

18
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.710
Hannah Ackermans: that's fine there's uses the platform scaling, which is very as a 14 says to accommodate multimedia and multi linear research specifically built for humanities publications.

19
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.190
Hannah Ackermans: Although there is a learning curve to scale our and my readers were confused when they first started looking at not finders.

20
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.140
Hannah Ackermans: The writer use of it allows for both authors and readers to familiarize themselves with a common structure of research and publication.

21
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:27.510
Hannah Ackermans: At the same time, the users can choose which elements to adopt an appropriate desert to suit their needs and ideas Dini explained, for example, there was important that pathfinders would look scholarly and bookish.

22
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.180
Hannah Ackermans: To the institution on bedding influences how authors choose and approached our media content, as well as how to book is circulated and read.

23
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.810
Hannah Ackermans: rediscover consider academic validity through a combination of their evaluation of the content and there are other experiences with born digital publication.

24
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:56.400
Hannah Ackermans: One of my readers, for example, has a background in film studies and she compared it to a video essay in her fields and she also said that she was reminded of the streaming platform twitch.

25
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.590
Hannah Ackermans: So what follows is the technological influence of the combination of platforms which extends the book beyond the cell phone thing text.

26
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:18.030
Hannah Ackermans: different platforms, such as vimeo and soundcloud are embedded and readers can cross through relevant external websites using the hyperlinks or they can encounter parts of the work through other channels before even entering the book.

27
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:28.200
Hannah Ackermans: So it is inevitably leads to differences and interpretation by different breeders and the explicit for all of the different platforms highlights this practice.

28
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.950
Hannah Ackermans: The central focus on situation on network documentation for grants devalue of documentation and presentation as officer sorry.

29
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:49.260
Hannah Ackermans: The value of documentation and presentation of sources as research, the spontaneity and interpretation are integral part of what is presented as the documentation of the networks themselves.

30
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.060
Hannah Ackermans: To do concludes by media specific analysis has become commonplace in various studies of creative digital artifacts.

31
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:08.340
Hannah Ackermans: Analysis of born digital academic publications could enhance the understanding of these particular text, as well as contribute to a more intricate application of media specificity, to include context.

32
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.380
Hannah Ackermans: academia, in particular, has explicit and implicit costumes of creating cultural capital in producing and circulating knowledge.

33
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:28.170
Hannah Ackermans: As publication is a primary in principle mode, for which scholars get to know each other works scrutiny of their month scrutiny of their media mode is necessary to understand the fields.

34
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.080
Hannah Ackermans: So I will leave it at this, for now, and I look forward to discussing if we can further.

35
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.130
susiecronin: Great Thank you so much that was really rich and interesting and a lot packed in there to a short.

36
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:52.350
susiecronin: A short time and we'll go for questions at the end so we'll run straight into our next presentation if that's OK, with everyone so next up is bronwyn Patrick sin welcome bronwyn with.

37
00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:03.510
susiecronin: accuracy in Title or do we call this so we know a little bit about your about your presentation from the video we saw looking forward to hearing more about that no.

38
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:16.800
Bronwin Patrickson: Thank you susie and I was really interested in your paper Hannah too, because I do also talk about the impact of technology on the genre in my paper but i've actually dropped a lot of that discussion in this to try and keep it to five minutes.

39
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:26.130
Bronwin Patrickson: yeah interesting field and games honors a different as well to literary genre so there's an interesting crossover but i'm sorry doing.

40
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.850
Bronwin Patrickson: I was lucky enough to work on a wallace and gromit theme digital storytelling project.

41
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.340
Bronwin Patrickson: Self described as a documented story wallace and gromit being fixed up.

42
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:47.730
Bronwin Patrickson: is a really interesting hybrid project involving transmedia and mobile and minted reality play.

43
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.560
Bronwin Patrickson: As well as a single strand story and it raised a few issues that I want to talk about in this talk.

44
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.250
Bronwin Patrickson: partly about the hybridity of genres these days, but also about the aesthetics, of a single strand story.

45
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:06.420
Bronwin Patrickson: of just to say for this project, I was working with university of South Wales, as part of the collaboration with a consortium.

46
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:22.320
Bronwin Patrickson: of creative commercial practitioners dub fiction, is in a UK funded audience of the future, to demonstrate a project i'll start by playing you an excerpt from there, behind the scenes video so they can get an idea of the APP some it really helps to seven look at it.

47
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.330
Bronwin Patrickson: it's very exciting having wallace government involved in this project.

48
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:48.930
Bronwin Patrickson: With the big feels like it right it's a brand new wallace and gromit story video gameplay comic strips all held together by and after people download an APP on that smartphone audiences will interact with wallace and gromit calls texts and even.

49
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.710
Bronwin Patrickson: When you can say a rocket appears in your backyard it's just a fundamental reshaping story.

50
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:03.120
Bronwin Patrickson: So this is a quote from Edward Russell who's one of the producers of the project for featured in the video.

51
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:12.510
Bronwin Patrickson: And i'm going to delete that video continuous talk it's got the rest of this behind the scenes video, as well as some etc let's play and other relevant productions to what I want to talk about.

52
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:26.790
Bronwin Patrickson: He goes on to say i'm learning to say it's an interactive immersive storytelling experience realized through augmented reality on your phone that's the fastest way of saying it, but even that doesn't sort of bringing the translator and everything So this was a challenge.

53
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:41.970
Bronwin Patrickson: And it was partly about the use of emerging technologies that people were as much familiar with, like a as well as a mix of story and gameplay within wallace and gromit before except APP which had implications particular in terms of the expectation that audience has brought to it.

54
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:59.520
Bronwin Patrickson: In hybrid fields of possibilities double barreled way market terms like interactive narrative as opposed to the term narratives gain, for example, a very helpful as a signal the relative weight of any particular genre mix and they can also indicate related audience cultures.

55
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:08.460
Bronwin Patrickson: But they can also be misleading, at times, potentially emphasizing the politics of the referral media over the emerging politics of the new media mix.

56
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.920
Bronwin Patrickson: So to turn to that now tend to the APP in more detail it's delivered via essential enhanced mobile application.

57
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:25.320
Bronwin Patrickson: The application presents a predetermined story delivered via rich tapestry of serialized short multi platform media elements.

58
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:36.870
Bronwin Patrickson: Unlike traditional transmedia when network media might be distributed across a number of platforms, the entire multimedia story is presented by the central mobile application.

59
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:46.920
Bronwin Patrickson: So this offers a rich and variable experience but also highlights the classification challenges that genre defying emerging technologies compose.

60
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:58.200
Bronwin Patrickson: The participatory capacity or agency to make meaningful choices in an unfolding experiences traditionally regarded as one of the great pleasures of digital storytelling.

61
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:09.810
Bronwin Patrickson: In big fix up the newsfeed progression is made more dynamic, because of the variety of media presents as well as the story progression that enables over time.

62
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:16.500
Bronwin Patrickson: The lure of emerging technology engagements link to that position also help to make that process more intriguing.

63
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:28.980
Bronwin Patrickson: Together, these serialized transmedia storytelling strategies for mobile phone delivery offered away for fiction, is to exploit alternative alternatives to branch into a narrative structures.

64
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.200
Bronwin Patrickson: And this is an example it's gone on a bit follow and just pause this for a second, so this is a great example for you to see.

65
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:46.500
Bronwin Patrickson: Now, part of the motivation for this approach animation takes a long time to me, and they there's a risk of course if you get into this branch into narratives that we've got.

66
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:55.440
Bronwin Patrickson: competence or real explosion, there are established workarounds, but they were really keen to look at this single story Strand and link it to.

67
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.650
Bronwin Patrickson: The choice to choose which bits you you engage with and then also linked to gameplay.

68
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:14.010
Bronwin Patrickson: And they said, it also referring different pledges and agency there, so there are different pleasures is this one, maybe a few of you are familiar with, even goggles bleed these are about the ascetic pleasures of an experience.

69
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:28.710
Bronwin Patrickson: And this is, you know the rhythmic and and the sound of the of the downtime and the signal to move, you know you're moving your holster from side to side, and then the visual humor of the page itself becoming bloodied.

70
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:37.650
Bronwin Patrickson: So each click reveals a bit more of the unfolding story enhanced by the odd surprise such a novel and interns perfect.

71
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:47.370
Bronwin Patrickson: And this approach, supports and engaging participatory experience, even despite the lack of meaningful agency and other examples of.

72
00:11:48.030 --> 00:12:05.280
Bronwin Patrickson: digitally reference kinesthetic pleasures rewards as they might be referred to engage me discourse You might remember the intermittent audio fx and read update animations like in Allen bigelow's 2017 mobile search doll narrative how to rob a bank.

73
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.040
Bronwin Patrickson: Now, in following projects fiction is are exploring ways that multi perspective narratives told through the overlapping.

74
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:21.090
Bronwin Patrickson: and potentially contradictory iterations of multiple characters and also complement the chunk news fleet plot progression.

75
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.520
Bronwin Patrickson: This approach prompts another alternative to the pleasure of agency, which is the pleasure of evaluation.

76
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.090
Bronwin Patrickson: In some game genres the pleasures of evaluation form strategy horses strategy choices sorry.

77
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:39.210
Bronwin Patrickson: And they also and we've moved on to another project now that I want to show you this is pirate fishing, this is an interactive documentary.

78
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:49.980
Bronwin Patrickson: And they can involve ethical dilemmas to prompt deep reflection this scrolling documentary indicates, yes, another way to introduce evaluative interaction into a single scrolling story.

79
00:12:50.580 --> 00:13:00.090
Bronwin Patrickson: Participants I cast as training investigators, who can help the pirate fishing investigation team by evaluating and classifying Midi elements, according to the type of information provided.

80
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:14.370
Bronwin Patrickson: Whether it's evidence notes or background information i'll just have to move this because I realize you can't see that so they're actually moving that around and there are all sorts of ways, you can see that something like that developing.

81
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:27.570
Bronwin Patrickson: In this they get bad as it could be much more dynamic, it could be mixed animations know and it's a really interesting seamless way to link the gameplay to to the story itself.

82
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:35.610
Bronwin Patrickson: So, as these numerous examples indicate there are captivating alternatives and adjustments to branching tree plot structures.

83
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:48.330
Bronwin Patrickson: And, many of which involve genre hybridity and these alternatives emphasize the importance of a dynamic towards storytelling experience as much as a dynamic text so that's it for me i'll stop sharing.

84
00:13:49.710 --> 00:14:00.240
susiecronin: Thanks Thank you so much for honoring That was really engaging and i'm sure there'll be lots of things to stitch together between this and the next presentation and the previous one.

85
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:07.410
susiecronin: And so next up is rob Gallo her whose presentation is entitled from cinema and via social media and be.

86
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.090
susiecronin: The changing face of video game characterization in the age of.

87
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.910
susiecronin: platform ization so we'll.

88
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.230
susiecronin: continue with the next presentation whenever you're ready all.

89
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:31.470
Rob Gallagher: Right thanks i'm realizing a full heartedly that I cut down my presentation to five minutes before i'd read everyone's full papers and I think there are lots of kind of interesting areas of overlap here but.

90
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.520
Rob Gallagher: Maybe we'll have to leave it to the to the Q amp a to bring some of those out.

91
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.220
susiecronin: definitely have time yeah in the discussion.

92
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:53.250
Rob Gallagher: yeah, hopefully, you can all now see my slides and and I want to talk about a particular example of transmedia storytelling from last year.

93
00:14:54.030 --> 00:15:10.770
Rob Gallagher: And in the summer of 2020 is the period when this character of virtual influencer called serafin began building an audience on Twitter on soundcloud and on instagram and you can see some of these accounts and posts here.

94
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:21.870
Rob Gallagher: And across these accounts and this character was flushed out the character of an easygoing if anxiety prone aspiring musician with big dreams and acute pet cat.

95
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.740
Rob Gallagher: And it was later in the year of the this character been building a fan base for a few months.

96
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:40.020
Rob Gallagher: That riot games revealed that they had created the character and that this character was joining the roster of their multiplayer online battle arena league of legends.

97
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.880
Rob Gallagher: So this was a kind of launch campaign, essentially for a video game character.

98
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:52.200
Rob Gallagher: And, and the approach to storytelling here was obviously informed by the self branding strategies to quote Duffy and horns.

99
00:15:52.530 --> 00:16:01.590
Rob Gallagher: And the small storytelling techniques to quote Alexandra Georgia copy and that have been pioneered by young female users of social media platforms.

100
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:18.900
Rob Gallagher: We could also course draw parallels with well known projects like Amalia ominous instagram series excellence is imperfections that uses that platform to to spin what turned out to be a fictional story or broods virtual influence little mckayla.

101
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:29.880
Rob Gallagher: And those perhaps more direct influence in the fields of a woman called stephanie Doris who, in November, I think it was.

102
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.310
Rob Gallagher: wrote a medium post.

103
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:45.210
Rob Gallagher: outlining her suspicion that riot had essentially plagiarized her online persona to create this character and detailing her short lived relationship with a riot employee.

104
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:54.750
Rob Gallagher: So, whether or not they were taking inspiration from particular individuals, and these are obviously the points of reference here for this mode of storytelling.

105
00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:08.700
Rob Gallagher: I think this is an interesting change in many ways for an industry, the commercial video game industry that traditionally has more readily look to Hollywood script writers for kind of narrative inspiration.

106
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:17.820
Rob Gallagher: So, in the early 2000s Eric Zimmerman accused video games of suffering from a bad case of what he called cinema envy.

107
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:25.050
Rob Gallagher: For much of this period the 90s early 2000s commercial game is kind of aspired to this condition of interactive cinema.

108
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:35.760
Rob Gallagher: And, as recent blockbusters like the last of US pot to demonstrate plenty of games still follow this model and ellie the heroine of this gritty revenge saga.

109
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:45.720
Rob Gallagher: Is a character conceived according to traditional Cinematic notions of plotting and characterization with dynamic developments or Arc that leaves her irrevocably changed.

110
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.800
Rob Gallagher: And, and these kinds of models of storytelling can work well for single player video games which players tend to buy up front.

111
00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:01.860
Rob Gallagher: Much as you would a movie ticket or a BLU Ray disc and to work through challenged by challenge until they finished the plot and see the conclusion.

112
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:09.720
Rob Gallagher: And, in an age of platform ization however many of the most profitable video games, including league of legends follow a different model.

113
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:23.220
Rob Gallagher: League is a multiplayer game meant to be played over and over online with others it's free to play, and it makes its money through the sale of costumes or skins that transform the look of the character.

114
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:30.780
Rob Gallagher: And within the Games fiction each skin is framed is another version of that character belonging to their own alternate reality.

115
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:38.340
Rob Gallagher: In January tons terms, these characters are conceived from the get go as transmedia figures right for reinvention and reimagining.

116
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:48.600
Rob Gallagher: Thus serafin can be both a trainee magician from a steampunk fantasy city and an aspiring indie musician posting selfies from her nondescript bedroom.

117
00:18:49.140 --> 00:19:00.270
Rob Gallagher: Both versions of the character share a set of traits and visual signifiers that are supposed to kind of lend coherence across these different versions and there's obviously a very coherent palette to.

118
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:06.360
Rob Gallagher: And the character of led by contrast is much less malleable and much less cleanly legible.

119
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:20.400
Rob Gallagher: You could, if you so wish to buy a cutesy vinyl Franco pop doll of her and, but I think this translation reveals that this really isn't a character designs to be reimagined in these ways the kind of real photorealistic visual style is quarter.

120
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.730
Rob Gallagher: How she's meant to circulate and be received, and I think in an age of platform ization.

121
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:34.230
Rob Gallagher: As game developers seek to keep players attached to these properties and to keep them playing and generating data.

122
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:48.510
Rob Gallagher: And what we may be seeing is less this convergence of film and games that was predicted in the early 2000s and more future that looks like serafin rather than la that's kind of the essence, my argument so needed there.

123
00:19:50.880 --> 00:20:02.940
susiecronin: Great Thank you so much rob I think it's really interesting to look at this gaze and this idea of envy and reciprocity and replication and mimicry between sort of reality and the.

124
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.710
susiecronin: Online realm so that's going to definitely feel some interesting discussion.

125
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:15.240
susiecronin: And so we're on to our last presenter we're moving quite speedily but i'm looking forward to the discussion that that will allow us to have.

126
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:30.900
susiecronin: So we're on to Maria mensa who his presentation is entitled digital methodologies for analyzing and disseminating Community research societal, cultural, political ethics and perspectives so whenever you're ready, we feel free.

127
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.540
meal.

128
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:57.870
Maria Mencia: Okay, so now from fiction and influencers on social media and augmented reality we are actually going to do you know reality in this project, they determine when i'm going to be talking about certain methodologies that I developed in.

129
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.960
Maria Mencia: With my projects on Community building and Community research and.

130
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.390
Maria Mencia: Sorry, I got a problem with our guests.

131
00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:25.080
Maria Mencia: So yeah so the same research on creative practices and research through electronic literature and is something that I have been doing life for 20 years now on practice based research and.

132
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:36.330
Maria Mencia: I mentioned in the paper how online platforms have taken a major role serving and and you know major role serving I mean.

133
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:57.060
Maria Mencia: to endure in the copy 19 situation more variable there and we have been learning to do what we did before at a distance, and in some cases, even in isolation and as an artist and researcher and engaging practices, I have for a while now.

134
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.740
Maria Mencia: use a sound.

135
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:09.090
Maria Mencia: Such online platforms to create spaces to share personal stories, so the storytelling that i'm talking about is more like life stories and.

136
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:21.120
Maria Mencia: I have been able to connect narratives to bring up issues of power territory displacement personnel on historical memory, gender and violence and.

137
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:30.510
Maria Mencia: So these are issues that i'm interested in researching through electronic literature understanding electronic literature in out really broad a.

138
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:44.730
Maria Mencia: way of life, digital art or digital storytelling you know you know in poetry all these young girls that we're discussing here, and so on and so yes now with them.

139
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:56.190
Maria Mencia: You know the copy 19 global pandemic has made me Father address the value that artistic practice a can have in our mental and psychological health.

140
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:04.950
Maria Mencia: Any significance in Community healing, so this is something that I have become interested from some of the projects that I have done, and also from.

141
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:17.490
Maria Mencia: The pandemic, so this is a very new topic to me and and is one of their strengths and developed has developed for my recent works.

142
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:30.060
Maria Mencia: So how can we create meaningful projects that can have an impact in society, this is what is the you know, this is where i'm driving for now, you know by.

143
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:46.320
Maria Mencia: And so we have the idea of community and the co authorship in the co creative kind of maybe workshops that i've been doing, and this is them, they are working with artists and communities at once.

144
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:57.870
Maria Mencia: And this has been developed in lighting, the project of invisible voices or in their workshop that we did yesterday on share to heal as well and.

145
00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:11.850
Maria Mencia: which they were focused on so she had to associate associate total issues which occurred you to a specific as social or political circumstances of a period in time.

146
00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:20.910
Maria Mencia: And they address questions in connection to communities to histories, the value that creative storytelling anarchistic approaches.

147
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:38.580
Maria Mencia: can have in sharing personal stories and the value of working directly with participants, so the paper also highlights the impact these projects can have not only to this specific communities, but also to society in general.

148
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:40.590
Maria Mencia: So.

149
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:54.960
Maria Mencia: Okay, so I also discuss a little bit there and then Internet as a medium is a platform for communication and dissemination, you know with a net are to Internet art but.

150
00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:14.880
Maria Mencia: You know, in a way, comparing it with the media technologies, nowadays, which are more ingrained in our lives are sent to 18 our dependence on online communication, the way we experience our everyday life communicate interact and understand the social, cultural itself.

151
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:27.630
Maria Mencia: So the digital media which some of these projects, obviously, are also presenting so coming 19 make it even more imperative to think of new ways to build.

152
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:44.370
Maria Mencia: applications where users can share personal stories concerns mental health problems challenges or social issues through narrative methods and media our practices so Community research is there the point here.

153
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:55.080
Maria Mencia: and building communities and sharing stories through the detail creative practices we did this on the workshop yesterday with the initials market.

154
00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:15.600
Maria Mencia: And we created this platform where we could share a story, and then the, but these stories will be shuffled and the participant will get I story to to heal, you will have to create digital media project to create that way to heal that story and.

155
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:23.040
Maria Mencia: And so again, it was about Community building and creating meaningful conversations we had a little bit of.

156
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:40.500
Maria Mencia: problem with technology, but we managed to actually get to those meaningful conversations in the end, and this is the platform, and this is where you actually get the story here and and then in this other.

157
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:49.200
Maria Mencia: kind of window you're able to write the digital media project I do you know to heal the story that you've been allocated.

158
00:26:49.860 --> 00:27:00.750
Maria Mencia: Okay, so these are just some of the I thought I just put these images in here i'm not going to go through all these, but these are just examples that I discussing the.

159
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:10.200
Maria Mencia: India essay as well, and I have to say that they say say will change quite a lot, because I will be focusing more on the methodology.

160
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:19.680
Maria Mencia: And i'm using some other material for something else, anyway, but this again is like you got them the website documentary of the project, which is.

161
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.880
Maria Mencia: Personal story, based on the Spanish Civil War, then we have this submit your story you got them archive.

162
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:39.510
Maria Mencia: And all the stories that are in them submit your story and in the archive they're also part of the deployment that digital media or electronic literature, if you want a poem.

163
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.150
Maria Mencia: And these are kind of methodology that i've been using and, of course, the Nice all the discussions.

164
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:54.060
Maria Mencia: Are through the presentation, some people that have also turnout from different places that were the standards of the winnebago passengers as well.

165
00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:12.210
Maria Mencia: These are serious mythologies that you can see, in that paper in terms of life stories and Dr Lambert and so on, and then also with them invisible voices, this is one of the recent projects.

166
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:23.520
Maria Mencia: And this is, I was working with women victims of the Colombian conflict and with a community groups so squad with the Pacific, so I discussed these more on their.

167
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:39.450
Maria Mencia: On their paper as well, I don't know if you have time to read it, but a game, there was the aim of giving voice to the women victims of their participation their construction of memory and then there was the you know through Ada digital.

168
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:50.880
Maria Mencia: technologies, but also a face to face, and this methodology of co creation with something, something that we were using.

169
00:28:51.450 --> 00:29:00.420
Maria Mencia: And this idea of urban design is based on our libertarian relationship between the signers of potential users and not on our rationale one.

170
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:08.940
Maria Mencia: in which the designer is seen as a superior Okay, so this is where he was leading their workshops.

171
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:15.720
Maria Mencia: And then, also the working with by DC bonds, the different continuation of methods for that, but that is specific context.

172
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:26.460
Maria Mencia: And the Multi modality is they are, they are you know, the use of the APP as well, for them to share their stories in different multimodal ways through video video.

173
00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:40.560
Maria Mencia: or written manner as well, and then why storytelling This is again a methodology that is being used now in public health Community based participatory research and practice which.

174
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:49.020
Maria Mencia: yeah we used as well, and here are the workshops that you can have one day, you can have a look on the website that I put on the chat.

175
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:59.340
Maria Mencia: And these were the outcomes, you know which is, including all kinds of things, because in the website do have his live shows installation, so their stories videos.

176
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:11.940
Maria Mencia: And, and then is the digital art work which is like a summary of the whole thing and then is the application as well, so yeah i'm nearly finished with.

177
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:25.830
Maria Mencia: There is a whole series of audio recordings be the documentation so and then digital art, which is the value in three different areas, and also in the essay I haven't actually gone through the whole thing.

178
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:35.310
Maria Mencia: In terms of the metaphor that i've been using as well to develop these work and then this idea of the impact.

179
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:46.770
Maria Mencia: That our practices have perhaps are scaling methodologies and with the some feedback with with the women and, for instance, from the point of view of co creation.

180
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:55.620
Maria Mencia: Is this they felt that they have this emotion and joy of seeing their work of art come to life and.

181
00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:03.120
Maria Mencia: And they said I say my my work of art, because they felt like that, so that was quite interesting to be able to you know to.

182
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:12.510
Maria Mencia: make them feel part of it, and then also with the more that I miss media online digital platforms again they also by enjoy working with.

183
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:25.590
Maria Mencia: Perhaps the same topics in many different ways that makes me makes me the our practices here because they thought that using all the senses the healing aspect is more intense and accurate.

184
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:44.550
Maria Mencia: And then, just the last thing as well, is that how, through our they felt that they were also given voices to those who have no voices and and do we need through art was less painful okay so i'm going to leave it in there to really Russia.

185
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:54.750
susiecronin: is very much Rhea that's great and so, if you could remove the screen share that will be great and we'll move into the questions for anyone listening who hasn't been presenting.

186
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.440
susiecronin: If you'd like to type your question into the chat please do so.

187
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:07.140
susiecronin: And if you want to ask it yourself, of course, you're free and encouraged to unmute yourself and ask your question, but if you could just pop the Q into the chat and then we'll try and.

188
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:20.160
susiecronin: avoid an overlap, by doing that and I have loads of questions but i've done that thing where i've written so much that I can't find my questions, but I was writing as I went along one thing that struck me, which I thought was worth.

189
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:34.890
susiecronin: abusing my privilege of moderator to ask was that idea of what's at stake between the individual and the collective So how do we gain or lose from a.

190
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:44.670
susiecronin: sort of installing oneself within an online community, and I think that's particularly potent in hannah's and maria's work, the idea of.

191
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:53.040
susiecronin: entering a dialogue that becomes representative of oneself, there is an element of loss and an element of gain in that.

192
00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:08.910
susiecronin: And subscription to an online community and I wondered if that would maybe prompt any further reflections or ideas from either of you have had that sort of em almost dialogue between individual and Community expression comes into play in your work.

193
00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.580
Maria Mencia: yeah So do you want me to start.

194
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:17.850
susiecronin: And sure, maybe Hannah was that you can use from we just presented we'll do a little inverse.

195
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:26.400
Hannah Ackermans: Oh it's like the pathfinders like as people in unit they'll probably know that was sort of a first.

196
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.450
Hannah Ackermans: project like eight nine years ago now.

197
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:44.730
Hannah Ackermans: um where the author would come in and explain things about their work, but also different readers would be there, and you would have the film experience of those readers so that's very individual but because you have several people.

198
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:50.370
Hannah Ackermans: It does show different examples, and it does give you more of an experience like.

199
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:59.490
Hannah Ackermans: It incorporates the idea that documenting the experience is part of documenting the work, especially if the work is lost.

200
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.120
Hannah Ackermans: And since then and.

201
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:13.290
Hannah Ackermans: i've explained this further in like the longer version of my article, but since then, this practice of the reversals especially has developed with.

202
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:29.370
Hannah Ackermans: A lot more works that are presented in the same way, but also moving this reversals from doing it in a studio to doing it publicly, so there have been a bunch of reversals that's happened at, for example in the yellow conference.

203
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:38.730
Hannah Ackermans: And I think acm and different places where there was a public presence, while this was happening and it became more of a communal.

204
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:57.150
Hannah Ackermans: Experience with the people in the room, and then obviously over the past year, it has also turned digital which changes the experience a bit because it's an important element of reversals normally that it's on the original machines that it was the work wasn't made on.

205
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:17.850
Hannah Ackermans: So for assume that's a bit different to have to be I can emulation of it um but then also people can join in and watch it so it's turned from purely like the documentation in the studio to this social and performative practice right great.

206
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.780
susiecronin: that's a really rich answer Thank you so much, and Maria I guess the notion of the collective.

207
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:40.560
susiecronin: comes into play, very much in terms of solidarity, building and healing as something that is shared, rather than individual so that transition from individual suffering to maybe healing as a collective vehicle is interesting in terms of your work.

208
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.820
Maria Mencia: Yes, and.

209
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:51.240
Maria Mencia: And will, as I presented in the different slides, you can see into yesterday it anyway.

210
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:08.880
Maria Mencia: So, nobody was like, for instance, in the case of a point across the Atlantic, it was interesting that I started doing the project without really knowing much about the Community, and then I land.

211
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:17.730
Maria Mencia: Through the online platform and their stories and I learned about it, you know, so it was a very different way to.

212
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:29.400
Maria Mencia: The world with that we made in where you know you are in a physical space and you develop in the work and then is there the idea of taking these word completing on online.

213
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:38.700
Maria Mencia: And, which you know talking about this periods as well, and I think that if we had only done the workshops and experience everything through.

214
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:45.180
Maria Mencia: The different a mixed media works that we need is a completely different thing to actually then.

215
00:36:45.840 --> 00:37:01.500
Maria Mencia: You know, was the experience was enhanced by actually see it online as well, and then they they could feel like they were part of them get there were all those other work anyway, so they gave them this agency and.

216
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:18.060
Maria Mencia: and empower men in a way, you know to see their work online and the fact that I was going to be distributed and published, and you know many other people we're going to be able to see that, instead of just staying in the confines of a workshop.

217
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:26.730
susiecronin: Thank you so much, and I can see a really good intersecting question so i'm going to just kind of cherry pick that here, Christine works as written in the chat marissa.

218
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.750
susiecronin: How did the Colombian women feel about their stories being available on the web platform.

219
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:45.510
susiecronin: Did you are they anonymize them, and I think I think you've already answered that, to a degree that it was an empowering factor as opposed to the loss of anonymity sort of was offset by the gain of the empowerment of sharing that story and having a platform for.

220
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:53.190
Maria Mencia: is still is still has to be anonymize because of their problematic or putting a name towards a story.

221
00:37:54.570 --> 00:38:07.320
Maria Mencia: And, but but yes, but at the same time, they they can recognize their own stories, they are anyway and see the stories from the the other participants so and so that's that's how they feel their their.

222
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:19.650
Maria Mencia: homes that Christine yeah so they fell yes in power and yeah with agency and and they felt that they were the author says yes, what I was actually explaining it.

223
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.490
Great so that.

224
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.780
Maria Mencia: sense of self you want one thing that is important is that they.

225
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:32.610
Maria Mencia: felt that they they were actually taking part in the historical memory, which in fact they were completely.

226
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:46.590
Maria Mencia: You know they are it doesn't exist in in history, you know what has happened to them, they travel, so they have gone through everything, and in that way they they felt that they were actually writing history in a different way yeah.

227
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:59.700
susiecronin: brilliant Thank you so much, and I will jump next to carlotta who has their hand raised to I imagine is possibly asking an interesting question also so we'll stay on team and then we'll move to the person who has a number of questions as well.

228
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.480
Carlota Salvador Megias: hi i'm oh i'm.

229
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:19.080
Carlota Salvador Megias: i'm in a room where the talk is being projected um yeah I ended up feeling like my question was a bit too specific, for the general conversation that was happening so I lowered my hand, so you can feel free to skip over me.

230
00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:25.440
susiecronin: Oh that's no way, even if you want to continuously that's okay too specific questions are already.

231
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:26.880
Carlota Salvador Megias: I know it's Okay, thank you.

232
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:34.350
susiecronin: Okay perfect so we'll jump next to dina would you prefer if I read out your questions or would you like to ask them yourself.

233
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:53.910
Deena Larsen: Basically, my put my questions boil down to everyone, how do you see these platforms in helping authors tell their life stories in what is one major advantage to each of your platforms, that is present in this technology that's not present in oh say pen and paper.

234
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.710
susiecronin: Thank you that's a huge question.

235
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:11.160
Hannah Ackermans: I can, maybe start sure yeah so there's a lot of answers to this without try to narrow it down a bit.

236
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:27.720
Hannah Ackermans: Not so much maybe about pathfinders but the scale is also used for different types of stories and I am also doing sort of a parallel project of how is it used as an academic platform that it's meant for but also how is it used as a platform for works of feelings.

237
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:48.720
Hannah Ackermans: And their choice to use an academic platform, so there are various creative works, for example, Stephen wingate has made Daddy labyrinths which i'm not sure if people are familiar with, but at this a digital memoir that's made own platform on schema, and this is used.

238
00:40:50.910 --> 00:41:02.190
Hannah Ackermans: For a lot of furnaces he came to know the platform from a yellow conference and he thought this is like my Member I need to use this i've been struggling for decades, but how to write this, and now I can do it.

239
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:15.450
Hannah Ackermans: Because it's multi linear and every piece in scale or can be part of a path, but you can also make it part of several parts, the same piece of text so you can start reading.

240
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.910
Hannah Ackermans: At a certain point.

241
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:33.990
Hannah Ackermans: and have different texts that makes sense, after each other move to our next path and at a certain point, your earlier runs come back again so then it's it's helping tell a life story, not just of the chronology of what happened, but also how memory works.

242
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:45.390
Hannah Ackermans: How things come back several ways within different context, which is also how research work so it's this overlap between doing the research and having to experience.

243
00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:54.390
Hannah Ackermans: So that's one answer to it there's a lot of ways that you can use multimedia model and multi linear.

244
00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:02.100
Hannah Ackermans: Elements of scale, but I think this might be most of what you were looking for here that's great.

245
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:10.290
susiecronin: Thank you and I noticed as well, I know you had your hand raised earlier if you wanted to as you're already unmuted maybe if you wanted to add in a question that you may have.

246
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.950
Hannah Ackermans: And I have like sort of a bigger question for.

247
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:21.960
Hannah Ackermans: Both about the surfing and about wallace and gromit so I can do that later after people have answered this question.

248
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:27.180
susiecronin: OK let's continue with other people who may want to come up with a question we were just on.

249
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:37.020
Rob Gallagher: I would, and I guess this maybe speaks to what Maria was saying, where in her case this platform has kind of.

250
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:50.010
Rob Gallagher: Ethics and security at its heart, it sounds like from the paper, whether it's encryption whether it's giving people the right to withdraw stories they've shared you're very concerned with the terms on which people are visible.

251
00:42:51.180 --> 00:43:03.390
Rob Gallagher: And to take instagram as as a kind of contrary example where maybe to take specific that instance of someone who, rightly or wrongly felt that their image had been kind of appropriated or plagiarized.

252
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.830
Rob Gallagher: A platform like instagram whether or not we want to see it as helping.

253
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:18.360
Rob Gallagher: One of the things central to it is the feedback mechanisms that allow people to kind of calibrate in tune how they present themselves to see what gets a response, what gets likes what gets comments.

254
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:25.350
Rob Gallagher: So I think that dimension has to be sort of taken into account, and I think it's often finishes rather than helpful.

255
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:38.460
Rob Gallagher: But with marines projects, I think we can see a real contrast about what a platform for sharing stories might look like if those questions of ethics and Community were at the heart, rather than the kind of competition for attention and the desire to make spreadable content.

256
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.040
susiecronin: I think that's really interesting and, if I may jump in there, with just kind of.

257
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:52.260
susiecronin: A not quite yet formulated question it kind of speaks to a lot of the kinds of ideas that i'm going to present on on Friday in.

258
00:43:52.650 --> 00:44:01.200
susiecronin: Work that i'm doing at the moment on refugee narrative and how am content created by and for people on the move POPs into.

259
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:10.380
susiecronin: platforms like instagram and almost passes completely on notice, as the result of the way in which the platform is set up to privilege certain kinds of content.

260
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:22.410
susiecronin: And so I was thinking in both Brahmins and rob's presentation this idea of pleasure and lunatics or something that sort of really propels forward the success of.

261
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:37.620
susiecronin: games or narratives or a persona, as the case may be, and whether that, as you say that idea of feedback and this growth in response to popularity rather than in response to kind of what has informed.

262
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:46.800
susiecronin: The projection of that story or that persona whether that kind of appetites, on the other end either creates a kind of suction effect and sort of.

263
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:58.140
susiecronin: em promotes a whatever it may be content on social media or a game or its popularity and how that sort of distortion.

264
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:18.930
susiecronin: can be dealt with and as well just to kind of intersect that with the idea of activism and empowerment and healing as potentially pleasurable practices as well and kind of along the lines of how Adrian Murray Brown and conceives of pleasure activism real whether that idea of.

265
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.500
susiecronin: healing and Community building and empowerment can be sort of.

266
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:40.800
susiecronin: brought forward and disseminated, on that basis, you know and made to the idea of appeal is very problematic when we're looking at serious content in inverted commas, as opposed to more.

267
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:51.660
susiecronin: An image based or more pop culture sort of content, so I wonder whether that gives us something to think about in terms of the way in which lewd acts and pleasure drive.

268
00:45:52.260 --> 00:46:03.870
susiecronin: and drive the privileging of content in online space sorry that was extremely long and rambling I can see bronwyn has their hand raised so be great to hear from you.

269
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.540
Bronwin Patrickson: yeah I wanted to talk a little bit to Dennis question as well.

270
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:23.190
Bronwin Patrickson: into in terms of your question it's it's a big question and just a point i'd say I think experience is potentially transformational that's been the the principle of a lot of spontaneity work.

271
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:38.130
Bronwin Patrickson: And, and then that can be easily scaffold by linking it to gain space with learning strategies, you know, because then you have the transformative experience and then you have other processes in place to help.

272
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:48.780
Bronwin Patrickson: process that into a swipe of inside, so the experiential fun element playful element allows people to step outside their everyday conditioning and.

273
00:46:49.080 --> 00:47:02.130
Bronwin Patrickson: start to touch a new insight through a direct kinesthetic experience so that's one value of it in terms of mobiles in terms of the Platform getting back to doing this question of bibles.

274
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:07.770
Bronwin Patrickson: cuz originally with this brief they were given the option to do vr or they chose a.

275
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:15.450
Bronwin Patrickson: Because you know vr is like you're very kind of isolated when these headsets and, in fact, they work rolling museums installations.

276
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:28.470
Bronwin Patrickson: But in people's lives people attending to engage with my balls and they're actually very inclusive technology in general they've been wonderful documentaries, which actually invited people from South America to.

277
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:42.000
Bronwin Patrickson: call in and tell their stories about corruption on a mobile phone and just call in and like a renewal number, and that was a way to really access people who wouldn't normally they haven't phone they don't have a computer they have a fine.

278
00:47:43.080 --> 00:48:01.020
Bronwin Patrickson: And and actually the studies have shown that mobile phones are generally used by a lot more different ethnicities as well it's not just usual subjects, you know it's kind of like the access of choice, even if it's shared by 10 people you know it's it's a tool for access and.

279
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:13.350
Bronwin Patrickson: Related to that as well, in terms of it's like a portal into the everyday you know, particularly a way of transforming the everyday experience we think technology is like a are.

280
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:21.600
Bronwin Patrickson: Now technologies like ar I think I agree with that dina they're not really accessible teaching or author and what my you know.

281
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:32.460
Bronwin Patrickson: strong impression in this project was how technologically informed, it was and how important the technology was to the process and it was an expensive process as well.

282
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:38.610
Bronwin Patrickson: And the other thing with my balls is you could you could develop an APP and next thing they.

283
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:52.140
Bronwin Patrickson: update the apple's operating system and it doesn't work anymore right there is some real issues there with with the technology and in in general for most authors working independently i'd recommend.

284
00:48:52.770 --> 00:49:10.200
Bronwin Patrickson: Working with an established platform that they they worry about the the updates and you're just making progress and content that's going to keep working on that on that platform However, having said that, I think there's just so much value in mobile as a as a medium of expression.

285
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:15.690
Bronwin Patrickson: And, and in terms of the value of for authors it's the same sort of value of.

286
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:26.550
Bronwin Patrickson: going to transmedia as opposed to just writing on paper and I don't discount the value of just writing on paper there's a lot of value to that and pleasures in reading stories that are written.

287
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:46.830
Bronwin Patrickson: But there's also a lot of additional enhancements to be gained from visual media or experiential media or data and all these sorts of things that can come in a systematic context so it's transforming the writing absolutely and it's a new that's an interesting process.

288
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:56.220
Bronwin Patrickson: And it there are you know it's about finding the ways to do it in a way that's accessible, but certainly i'd say mobiles and a very accessible platform.

289
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:00.990
Bronwin Patrickson: Hope that's answered your question by.

290
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:08.280
Deena Larsen: Question does just back to Romans point or one of the things that we've been talking about, particularly in the right pads and the salons his.

291
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:23.040
Deena Larsen: House so many developing countries are explorer authors and readers are exploring electronic literature and the possibility of multi strand stories and telling their life stories and getting that support so.

292
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:45.390
Deena Larsen: It talks to all of your points and they're leapfrogging over the computer age into the mobile phone age, because that's the technology that's available practically everyone has a mobile phone practically no one has a computer or Internet access so it's it's it's key, I think, thank you.

293
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:54.180
Maria Mencia: yeah I just say something if you if anybody unless somebody that wants to talk a.

294
00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:55.380
susiecronin: Little area.

295
00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:05.640
Maria Mencia: Now is then just run when we read also the application, these are up you know for the women to be able to actually live their life stories.

296
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:14.820
Maria Mencia: Well, that was the fact that they were able to communicate in different ways, you know whether they wanted to leave our video which they are actually really used to it now.

297
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:24.750
Maria Mencia: And again, it was an easy way to to share their life story in that way, and also being anonymous anyway and.

298
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.090
Maria Mencia: And then also they could also look forward to switch again they're really familiarized with and.

299
00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:39.600
Maria Mencia: They could write it as well, but you know, writing, some of them were finally TV more difficult so that's why it was important that accessibility that dina was asking.

300
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:53.820
Maria Mencia: is found in that multi modality, you know and the way you know, like the sentence that I had in there, we explained the world we investigate all that in other ways, so so these these these multi modality as possible.

301
00:51:54.990 --> 00:52:00.990
Maria Mencia: And yeah kind of important in these projects that we were doing clinics abilities, mainly because I can make so many things.

302
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:09.900
susiecronin: that's a really interesting question as well the multimedia dimension and that idea of the audio message which I know is much more prevalent in.

303
00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:18.960
susiecronin: The kind of Latin American context is really valuable resource for people who might be daunted by the idea of sort of writing out word for word, their experience.

304
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:31.620
susiecronin: And I think there's also a really interesting kind of binary of sort of intimacy versus vulnerability and that idea, did you feel it was important to really preface the project with.

305
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:44.850
susiecronin: A sense of the projects diffusion and to whom sort of the work would be disclosed and in what way sort of these narratives would be used because I think there is something very sort of.

306
00:52:45.330 --> 00:53:01.680
susiecronin: intensely personal actually about speaking and audio message testimony almost into your own phone as if it's staying within your own sort of personal sphere and and yeah I just wondered how you approach that idea of him in a coma know.

307
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:12.480
susiecronin: Making space and making that space of diffusion sort of something to be interacted with preemptively.

308
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:24.840
Maria Mencia: yeah yeah well em this was kind of quite a big project, so we work with our whole group of people like a local impact coordinator in Colombia as well and.

309
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.230
Maria Mencia: And it was very important to start with her, I could understand where these women were coming from you know and.

310
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:46.950
Maria Mencia: Some of them had already been participating in workshops so so yeah you, you have to be, because it is this level of intimacy and yeah well in a web, you have to be like really careful in the way that I mean for me that was actually quite.

311
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:53.460
Maria Mencia: You know, to start with her, I was worried about it, you know is how am I going to actually be.

312
00:53:54.750 --> 00:54:08.550
Maria Mencia: able to to to develop this project with them without victimizing Then again, you know so so you have to understand the good open that's why, having other people that work with them before he really help.

313
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:16.050
Maria Mencia: To be able to post the right questions on the right dialogues and they were very, very open to actually talk.

314
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:36.630
Maria Mencia: and share their experiences so so yeah so that that yeah so in the end that that's how we deal with it, you know these kind of more interdisciplinary group of people researching these project, I mean mainly concentrated on their men, you know, on the kind of artistic side of it, everyone.

315
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.280
Maria Mencia: I don't know if we.

316
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:47.460
susiecronin: Can absolutely no I think it's that balance of putting the technology in place and putting the structure in place without over.

317
00:54:48.000 --> 00:55:01.170
susiecronin: Over determining the intentionality and allowing that kind of aspect of personal experience to drive what happens thereafter and allowing it to be something that takes the form of it, some.

318
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:05.880
susiecronin: Of it interlocutors pretty interesting rob has his hand.

319
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:18.450
Rob Gallagher: yeah I sort of had a question that I guess is for Hannah and bronwyn might not actually be a question but i'm Roman you talked about let's plays as a way of.

320
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:31.710
Rob Gallagher: learning about the experience of people using the software and navigating these various different elements and Hannah obviously this idea of the traverse or in terms of lacking a language for these emerging forms that that seems like a really valuable way of.

321
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:40.290
Rob Gallagher: Some of the same things that let's plays do have, what is the experiential dimension of this how our particular users navigating and activating what's here.

322
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.060
Rob Gallagher: So I wondered.

323
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:53.370
Rob Gallagher: I mean essentially I just like to hear both of you say a bit more about that and I wasn't sure, particularly for brahman whether these were part of the iterative design process, whether things are being tweaked on the basis of how players were responding or whether this is.

324
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.040
Rob Gallagher: You reflecting on on how it's been received.

325
00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:11.790
Bronwin Patrickson: and interesting, you mentioned that rob actually let's plays weren't so much apart user experience studies and user testing was a big part of the development process and but I tend to use let's plays increasingly in my own research and.

326
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:18.300
Bronwin Patrickson: I just find them such an invaluable resource and and it was interesting going back to some of the.

327
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:29.580
Bronwin Patrickson: Points susie question susie was reading about you know where's the authenticity in this pool, at the same time for sociality and attention and this attention economy.

328
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:39.480
Bronwin Patrickson: And it's very hard it's very hard actually susie to find them this you know let's play that i've been studying a merger of performance.

329
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:54.810
Bronwin Patrickson: and construction in the everyday and casualness you know so it's reflective of the everyday culture, but it clearly icons conscious construction, at the same time, but I find them such a really valuable resource it's interesting, you mentioned that by using the law increasingly.

330
00:56:55.110 --> 00:57:04.950
Rob Gallagher: I guess i'm thinking about this question of pleasures and which ones are kind of measurable understandable as well, because I mean, I think you talk about agency and how obviously.

331
00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:17.100
Rob Gallagher: Providing choices gets difficult logistically but sometimes it's I think Sarah Stan calls it interpretive agency that people find meaningful just the their own experience of navigating the content.

332
00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:27.630
Bronwin Patrickson: yeah that's so true I haven't I haven't sort of looked in depth, for the term interpretive agency, but I really like the sound of it i'll have to look into that a little bit more.

333
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:32.190
Bronwin Patrickson: yeah and I, and I think it's, as you say it's the.

334
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:47.670
Bronwin Patrickson: event I was talking about it in terms of valuation because I was thinking in terms of taking that step forward and then using your evaluation area your interpretations are then expressed and it kind of becomes part of the feedback loop, in some ways as well.

335
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:57.420
Bronwin Patrickson: And it lets players are also part of a dialogue because there's a in crime culture, because they broadcast live remember and there's quite a culture.

336
00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:14.040
Bronwin Patrickson: of people chatting underneath it and, interestingly, a lot of them will refer to other let's plays like so and so played this like this and you're doing it like this, so they obviously watched quite a few different lets players who might have followers of over 2 million each.

337
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:26.730
susiecronin: So there's almost like an internal referencing system at play on all of these platforms and I think that is really interesting is when we think about Sarah thing, where we think about and.

338
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:41.250
susiecronin: performative pretty on the platform as coming from experience of the Platform and that kind of prior phase of maybe not quite conditioning but engagement that's something that prefaces one's kind of more.

339
00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:54.090
susiecronin: more assertive sort of engagement and that idea of prior knowledge and I wonder whether that's something that feels and jarring when we.

340
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:59.670
susiecronin: Contrast content such as sort of influencer professionalism versus.

341
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:16.530
susiecronin: A project like maria's which works with the Community on a much more earnest basis of stories sharing and the more perhaps honest kind of sense of testimony and depiction of the everyday because I remember i'm looking at the moment at the idea of.

342
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:35.670
susiecronin: How communities are articulated online and how that feeds into kind of mimicry and as well that almost sort of co creates that precedent online call creates communities mimicking the online version and so that idea of sort of having.

343
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:43.500
susiecronin: Having a precedent and mimicking what is understood from the platforms on kind of.

344
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.600
susiecronin: Prior uses.

345
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:46.350
Bronwin Patrickson: is something that.

346
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.640
susiecronin: I think that loop is really.

347
00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.210
susiecronin: compelling.

348
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:50.460
susiecronin: I think i've lost myself in my own loop.

349
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:59.070
Bronwin Patrickson: So i'm cautious of saying that one's more authentic than the other only because I think performance is embedded in there in the everyday.

350
00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.020
Bronwin Patrickson: People perform any way.

351
01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:01.830
yeah.

352
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:17.910
Bronwin Patrickson: Whether it's for an audience of 2 million, I mean the ones who are doing it to an audience over 2 million or more polished but I wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't expect that other people, even if they were out of that context and doing a Community thing we're conditioned and performative.

353
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:24.090
Bronwin Patrickson: Yes, the only thing i'd say that would That would be my my my question around that.

354
01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.090
susiecronin: yeah Maria has her hand race.

355
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:45.120
Maria Mencia: Yes, and I wanted, I just wanted to ask rob Am I thought your paper was fascinating you know with this idea of the game remediate in social media.

356
01:00:45.570 --> 01:01:00.060
Maria Mencia: And it's not something that I had been you know, looking at or anything so, and so I wonder if you want to say sense of you know, to elaborate a bit about these kind of getting these.

357
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:11.610
Maria Mencia: characters from different contexts and whether, then it seems like it's something which is more commonalities the way that.

358
01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:24.480
Maria Mencia: A games are going at the moment yeah these remediation of their social social media instead of their filmic and but yeah no I really enjoy reading all this story about this.

359
01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:27.270
Maria Mencia: influencer that.

360
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:35.100
Maria Mencia: It wasn't real and I know this aspect of the subject on subjectivity southern everyone to say something on that.

361
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:42.840
Rob Gallagher: Sure, and I think, in that case there's there is a pleasure that comes from some of this blurring of genres and expectations.

362
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:48.180
Rob Gallagher: Is it fake or is it real you can enjoy the patent faintness of the virtual influencer.

363
01:01:48.660 --> 01:02:01.110
Rob Gallagher: But also, of course, one of the punishes things about influence the culture is that that blurring of boundaries allows for content that might seem sort of spontaneous and personal but it's actually branded and calculated to be to be shared.

364
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.350
Rob Gallagher: And, but yeah, I guess, I was interested in.

365
01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:15.210
Rob Gallagher: The extent to which the kind of economic imperatives and the economic context that makes certain forms of storytelling and characterization viable that maybe don't always get recognized.

366
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:23.880
Rob Gallagher: So in in a context of platform ization were keeping people in the platform generating data interacting with one another, is important and.

367
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.350
Rob Gallagher: I think a move towards this kind of small storytelling where you.

368
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:39.780
Rob Gallagher: have possibly a more intimate lowest stakes relationship with characters who don't change dramatically, but who kind of developed over time, is something that seems to becoming more common.

369
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:47.940
Rob Gallagher: I guess actually some of the really good literature on this is by city and area and Scott last you talk about wallace and gromit actually as examples of this.

370
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:55.680
Rob Gallagher: and about how that that serious plays with a certain sense of tax ality and mirror materiality, which is also one of the pleasures of the serafin account as.

371
01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:08.100
Rob Gallagher: shots of this virtual hand holding up a virtual polaroid of what purports to be the character, was a child, so there's a play with kind of the material and immaterial there that's also part of the pleasure, I guess.

372
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.000
Rob Gallagher: i'm not sure if that's what you found interesting.

373
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:18.360
Maria Mencia: yeah nice but it's also this idea, this idea of their personal stories as well and I were thinking how.

374
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:28.620
Maria Mencia: Could I even think of doing a project like you know, like dad with if you think about because I thought, how is my whole project is so real.

375
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:40.140
Maria Mencia: Connected to to you know to social media and these kind of fictional characters I don't really they are as influencers on there are no even really influencers on how would I actually.

376
01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:52.890
Maria Mencia: be able to perhaps use that with the women that i've been working with you know will kind of ethical problems will create or will they perhaps enjoy you know being influencers and so.

377
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.600
Rob Gallagher: I didn't talk about potentially much more artistically interesting games and.

378
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:09.360
Rob Gallagher: interactive pieces that i'm playing or critically with the ordinances of digital platforms and talk about these dynamics of kind of Revelation and secrecy and there are there are games that are doing that.

379
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:15.960
Rob Gallagher: For more of a kind of artistic context in a commercial one, so perhaps I should have alerted everyone to those instead.

380
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:32.430
susiecronin: that's really interesting though rob where where's the line you know I think there's a really interesting kind of set of signifiers going on that kind of signal that one is more sort of commotion one is more artistic and I really like that idea of.

381
01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:43.050
susiecronin: The digital is often where we fall into the blurring of the boundary or the fuzziness of the boundary between the two, and so i'd be really intrigued on probing that one.

382
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.750
susiecronin: that's not a sort of an order to speak.

383
01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:51.750
Rob Gallagher: I feel like.

384
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.150
Bronwin Patrickson: I really liked your point.

385
01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.190
Bronwin Patrickson: I really liked your points about the pleasures of materiality and the pleasures of.

386
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:12.060
Bronwin Patrickson: The fuzzy genre in itself, and I wonder how they how you see them looking to I mean, I can see them linking it back to the pleasures of evaluation and the pleasures of kinesthetic perfect as well and.

387
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:16.830
Bronwin Patrickson: and have to get the reference from you about the one about the materiality of wallace and gromit.

388
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:17.670
Bronwin Patrickson: Oh, thank you.

389
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.440
Bronwin Patrickson: that's really helpful.

390
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:24.330
Rob Gallagher: But maybe I could use this to ask candidates, a bit more, because I think that thing of.

391
01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:37.020
Rob Gallagher: materiality of the old computing hardware that you might need to authentically play classic electronic literature now, but also that question of the reversal was a genre is is really interesting i'd love to hear a bit more about that.

392
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:54.990
Hannah Ackermans: Oh yeah definitely that's like an important part of pathfinders and this approach, and it was also something that came up when I did the redirect reversals that they would come to first just see it happening on a screen that admittedly is like an old screen for us.

393
01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:05.850
Hannah Ackermans: and watch the videos but then move on to the document it's materials, which is photos of all the physical materials that you needed to have.

394
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:23.280
Hannah Ackermans: When you were going to play this work with long descriptions alongside it to explain everything and one of my readers wasn't mean oh I wasn't expecting this to be physical but that makes sense because it's from pre web, so you needed to have something.

395
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:30.390
Hannah Ackermans: And then, like getting really into these photos and things and just having like a card that says.

396
01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:39.810
Hannah Ackermans: look into description I think it's a there's a registration cards and she was like what's a registration cards and and scroll through to find the picture of the rich facing part and the.

397
01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:48.600
Hannah Ackermans: description of it and try to imagine what it was like to have to use that and why would we think it's important and all those kinds of.

398
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:58.020
Hannah Ackermans: Discussions around that so definitely the even like in the digital book did the math reality.

399
01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.240
Hannah Ackermans: is very important.

400
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:21.750
Maria Mencia: And Hannah also something that you mentioned, is the publication, you know this, the academic publication in connection to the method that they've been using in Pathfinder us as well, and I wonder if you want to say anything else about it.

401
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.620
Hannah Ackermans: Oh yeah sure i'm not sure what what direction.

402
01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:27.150
Hannah Ackermans: Release that and so.

403
01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.260
Maria Mencia: Well, I think it's.

404
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.530
Maria Mencia: Yes, it's just as a major thing you know where you know I mean like practitioners if we.

405
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:46.560
Maria Mencia: When we are in academia, you know, I think that if you're a practitioner doesn't matter how many kind of our work so whole digital media works you do if you don't have live written publications it doesn't seem to count.

406
01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:47.670
Hannah Ackermans: yeah yeah.

407
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.100
Maria Mencia: So that format, you know it's.

408
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.810
Maria Mencia: Still.

409
01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.030
Hannah Ackermans: quiet.

410
01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.740
Maria Mencia: yeah so.

411
01:07:56.070 --> 01:08:04.890
Hannah Ackermans: No definitely it's like the thing, but the institutional embedding that keeps coming up, which happens at the point of publication people.

412
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:11.850
Hannah Ackermans: Like Danny progressive, like us, they wrote a physical book and also had a digital book there they do different things.

413
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:21.690
Hannah Ackermans: But it's coming from the same research project and the physical focus from MIT press she's like well do you have like MIT press, especially in our field that's like the brass ring.

414
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:39.000
Hannah Ackermans: That opens everything, whereas with that fine there's no it's like a canonical book as I introduced it like if I talk about run digital publications with other people that find this is the first one they're like oh right i've heard of that.

415
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:45.870
Hannah Ackermans: But as Dini explain it's a a court respect.

416
01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:54.030
Hannah Ackermans: overtime and it doesn't have this automatic blessing, along with it, but that's, just like the beginning of it, where.

417
01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:05.010
Hannah Ackermans: it's also about how you use it like I said, one of my readers said, like oh yeah in film studies we have video essays.

418
01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:12.990
Hannah Ackermans: which used to not be taken seriously as academic work and now they're more and more seriously and then without like me prompting anything, she will mute it.

419
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:26.160
Hannah Ackermans: But I don't think that video essays get cited a lot so that's, like the other part of the institutional bedding brand citation isn't important, and I want to say currency because it's a transactional but.

420
01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.170
Hannah Ackermans: that's how things become part of the conversation so.

421
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:48.930
Hannah Ackermans: So for three days after like wonder like if I would cite this, how would I sided what media would have said what I cited as the book, would it be important to took the photos when i'm referring to the images and then there's all these little things that seemingly don't matter.

422
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.240
Hannah Ackermans: To themselves, but there are very important to like this academic context.

423
01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:05.010
susiecronin: that's great that's really interesting and that idea of a sort of implicit list of qualifications that kind of need to be always.

424
01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:05.730
crossed yeah.

425
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:11.670
susiecronin: encountered we don't have quite the fluidity that we feel we should have sometimes in.

426
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:15.150
susiecronin: terms of breaking into new media forums of.

427
01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:33.810
susiecronin: The new conversations, which is what it should be about so it's interesting to look at that lag and that sort of that idea of any conversation almost as a repository of value and how that value is kind of best best accumulated so.

428
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.350
Hannah Ackermans: Can I ask a follow up question about that too.

429
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:51.720
Hannah Ackermans: Because you said in your paper that optimum writing styles can vary across media and at the same time there's this increase of conversions media to think speaks like this do the fuzzy showers you just talked about.

430
01:10:52.290 --> 01:11:04.020
Hannah Ackermans: And I was wondering if you can explain more about how media expectations are still in some ways fulfilled and in other ways, suffered it in these multimedia convergence experiences.

431
01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:17.910
Bronwin Patrickson: Good good question I think it's a flux and I think it's hard it's hard to generalize because it can change, according to the context, because the relationships are very contextual and.

432
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:28.230
Bronwin Patrickson: Certainly, you know, because if you think about captions it's the effect of that is it's it's contextual and with the page and it's about relationships.

433
01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.650
Bronwin Patrickson: But certainly.

434
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:43.770
Bronwin Patrickson: You know because I used to work across different media platforms and we, we would see the different writing styles and it was well known that maybe some people could write for radio and not for print.

435
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:50.430
Bronwin Patrickson: yeah because I would different writing styles and they would find it hard to go across but then, if you move into the transmedia realm.

436
01:11:52.080 --> 01:12:09.600
Bronwin Patrickson: You know, it becomes an entity is conversational it depends on what's the caption and what color is the caption on the page and what what is this what is its function is it to impart information or is it for effect, or is it to be a bit more conversational.

437
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:18.810
Bronwin Patrickson: So i'm not sure that I can really answer your question in as much detail as you'd like it, because because I.

438
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.620
Bronwin Patrickson: Because I didn't.

439
01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.560
Bronwin Patrickson: know that oh sorry oh sorry.

440
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:26.040
Hannah Ackermans: I know that you're answering the question i'm wondering if maybe.

441
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:34.560
Hannah Ackermans: it's more about them, the production side and the reception side that's their current versions, as long as all the different people are there.

442
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:44.430
Hannah Ackermans: To do the specific things they're good at it becomes the one experience, but then you always need like the the groups of people that you would need for wallace and gromit them for surfing.

443
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:51.660
Hannah Ackermans: To work on these types of projects which would require a lot of resources again.

444
01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:10.440
Bronwin Patrickson: um yeah I think if you if you do have specialists, it really, really helps, certainly in the in the behind the scenes process in wallace and gromit it was coordinate they developed over the time they developed.

445
01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:21.120
Bronwin Patrickson: languages to be able to speak between each other, and they would actually be looking at and checking in because there was different understanding of terms between the different specialisms.

446
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:24.870
Bronwin Patrickson: And they would be developing that you know, even at the start, when I working with.

447
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:34.620
Bronwin Patrickson: admin they would sort of taught stuff to talk about the development story in terms of beats which is not something they normally did in the in the tech space, you know so they were.

448
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:48.750
Bronwin Patrickson: sort of learning to be agile in their communication styles anyway, but within that they they had specialisms they were very clear cut specialisms, so it is about this.

449
01:13:50.100 --> 01:14:01.110
Bronwin Patrickson: to and fro as well isn't it and it's Okay, if this is the challenge isn't it to define it because I think it's almost, it is about reception as much as a production.

450
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:08.010
Bronwin Patrickson: Because the production is informed by the reception and the reception is informed by this production.

451
01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.450
Bronwin Patrickson: I mean Mike Mike.

452
01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:15.540
Hannah Ackermans: Sorry continue.

453
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:28.950
Bronwin Patrickson: Well, I I have previous advocated that we need a new term that's a bit more of a neutral term and that we can hang these may markers on but that doesn't that this hasn't ever taken off there's just no term.

454
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:31.290
Bronwin Patrickson: and

455
01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:38.010
Bronwin Patrickson: So, in the meantime these way market to them seem to be particularly helpful the double barrel.

456
01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:49.230
susiecronin: that's great and there are a lot of kind of hybrid terms that are pending for a lot of the kinds of concepts and ideas we've been discussing today, I think.

457
01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:57.630
susiecronin: And I don't like to cut the panel short I feel like it's just the plant that's grown all these really interesting runners and the fruit is kind of in the making, so.

458
01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:10.260
susiecronin: Thank you all so much for a fascinating discussion and i'm just more than anything, flagging the time to let you have a break between now and the next discussion, but am I look forward to chatting with you and.

459
01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:16.380
susiecronin: sort of working together in this funny interconnected format, as the conference goes on.

460
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:30.390
susiecronin: And over the coming days, and thanks to all of our speakers today and to everyone for your brilliant questions and we'll wrap up here, for now, but i'm sure we'll be talking in between now and the end of the conference Thank you all so much again.

461
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.550
Maria Mencia: Thank you, everybody.

462
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:34.740
susiecronin: Everyone.

463
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.380
