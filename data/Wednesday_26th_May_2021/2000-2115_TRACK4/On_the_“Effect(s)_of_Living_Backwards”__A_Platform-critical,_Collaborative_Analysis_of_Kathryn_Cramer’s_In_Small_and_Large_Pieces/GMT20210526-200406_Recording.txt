00:35:57	Dene Grigar:	The SE 30 is a workhorse
00:37:24	Deena Larsen:	Hooray for cardboard!
00:37:30	Deena Larsen:	THank you
00:37:48	Dene Grigar:	The vinyl packaging made the paper inside of folio stick together and damage the floppy disk
00:37:48	Deena Larsen:	This is a book, rather than this is a scary computer thingy we don't like
00:38:08	Dene Grigar:	Hi Deena
00:38:11	Dene Grigar:	)
00:38:59	Mariusz Pisarski:	Crucial remarks about CD-rom vs floppy experience!
00:39:06	Dene Grigar:	yes
00:39:27	Dene Grigar:	The CD-ROM provided a smoother reading experience
00:46:43	Deena Larsen:	Maruscz it was more than that--it was the attitude changing from "What is this silly thing on people's desks and why have one" floppy disk era to "oh yes, of course I must have a computer!" CD rom
00:47:01	Deena Larsen:	You also don't get to see all of the lexia if you don't have the right typeface
00:48:55	Mariusz Pisarski:	Indeed, Deena. Floppy disk was perhaps more alike an experience of uncovering a secret, the ritual of loading the work, the surprise when it finally loads; whereas CD-rom, as Kathryn said - just like putting a dvd and watching a movie.
00:49:35	Deena Larsen:	tee hee. Live caption just translated electronic into "Luck chronic"
00:50:12	Deena Larsen:	WE had to hold every reader's hand--this is how you use a mouse
00:50:53	Dene Grigar:	Deena: this is how you slip a floppy in a drive
00:50:54	Jennifer Dellner:	@Mariusz: agree so much about the feeling of uncovering a secret when inserting a floppy disk, waiting for it to load, open
00:51:01	Dene Grigar:	this is how you use a cursor
00:51:04	Dene Grigar:	a mouse
00:55:17	Dene Grigar:	I am sad to see the loss of the fonts
00:55:51	Dene Grigar:	migration is a form of translation
00:56:14	Dene Grigar:	I see preservation methods all as forms of translation
00:56:41	Astrid Ensslin (she/her):	under!
00:56:54	Dene Grigar:	terrific visualizatons
00:56:57	Dene Grigar:	tions
00:57:10	Deena Larsen:	central nodes are central to the piece--until they shatter
01:02:44	Deena Larsen:	you also can not really emulate a work--because you have such different approaches to the tech--but this is like saying we canot watch a movie like Gone with the Wind in the same way as we have such different attitudes...
01:04:09	Dene Grigar:	We are not emulating anything by Eastgate.
01:05:43	Dene Grigar:	Varela’s The Embodied Mind is one of the most influential works in my own work.
01:07:15	Deena Larsen:	I think we can legitimize the emulations and remove that stigma more by casting these as readings, as ways to experience the work now.
01:07:40	Dene Grigar:	Translation studies also offers an out, Deena
01:08:02	Deena Larsen:	Yes. Translations and emulations gain their own reputation *as works*
01:08:26	Dene Grigar:	Christiane Paul prefers emulation to collection.
01:09:08	Dene Grigar:	The interest in the physical media has led to the retro game trend happening right now
01:09:12	Mariusz Pisarski:	I wander what are the outer limits of emulation: Brain Dance (from Cyberpunk 2077)?
01:09:51	Mariusz Pisarski:	Or perhaps emulation has no limits, and there will always be better emulations :)
01:10:24	Dene Grigar:	The hope is that the emulation experience will improve with the drive to access outmoded works
01:12:13	Dene Grigar:	5-10 seconds
01:12:47	Dene Grigar:	That was due to the Live Stream and Zoom combined for four people coming together from Europe and the US
01:17:25	Mariusz Pisarski:	This is a very good point, Kathryn, that the mirror world is seen in links, in action, as we read, and the visual analysis is not able to present it.
01:17:26	Dene Grigar:	It would not have been a Traversal in our early days:) It would have simply been a performance . .
01:17:38	Dene Grigar:	NOW it is a Traversal.
01:17:45	Deena Larsen:	We tried so hard to get links into e-readers
01:17:52	Deena Larsen:	and lost
01:23:46	Deena Larsen:	The emulation for William Dickeys work is wonderful and yet it causes problems for reading and interpretation as well. We can do that as Dickey's work never came out in Eastgate
01:24:20	Deena Larsen:	Yeah, I keep sticking my hand in that meat grinder... and I am so grateful to Dene for saving even some of my work. And all of our works--we can not even read these before they die.
01:24:34	Deena Larsen:	Kathryn wrote to the medium!
01:24:45	Dene Grigar:	We love your work, Deena.
01:25:12	Dene Grigar:	Did you see that we preserved Firefly for the exhibition?
01:25:25	Dene Grigar:	It turned out well
01:26:10	Deena Larsen:	The emulation for Firefly is fantastic, thank you
01:27:04	Dene Grigar:	Translation Studies holds that a work that is translated is a new work
01:27:34	Astrid Ensslin (she/her):	Which makes sense in terms of creativity (there's still a stigma attached to translation as being non-creative)
01:28:20	Dene Grigar:	I studied under two Translation Studies scholars who taught me that translators are the heroes of academe
01:29:01	Dene Grigar:	Without them, the work would be limited to a small audience or in the case of hypertext work—to noboby
01:29:05	Dene Grigar:	nobody
01:29:24	Deena Larsen:	The only copy of the original Black Mark I know of is in the floppies at  MITH.
01:29:48	Deena Larsen:	The commercially viable piece is vital
01:33:12	Deena Larsen:	WEll, we had the argument--do we go into academics or get on Oprah?
01:33:27	Deena Larsen:	And we just were not able to get the access... the bar was too high.
01:33:28	Dene Grigar:	Oprah
01:33:32	Dene Grigar:	She is nice
01:33:51	Deena Larsen:	Right, popular was a threat to academics--and academics were a threat to popular
01:34:28	Mariusz Pisarski:	This is exactly why the e-lit practice dried up recently in Poland. The academics received grants and ranks and the artists  had to emigrate to earn their living.
01:34:37	Justin Bortnick:	The commercial viability problem seems really interestingly like a Western problem - looking at the Japanese software market in the 90s where narrative game (or game-like)/text based experiences were (and are) a major market with a lot of innovation going on.  Do you have any guesses why that might be?  Was it something cultural, or was it just better marketing?  What's going on here?
01:35:01	Dene Grigar:	Good question
01:35:22	Deena Larsen:	Things were either too simple (make money) or too complex (Study the hell out of it)
01:35:26	Richard Holeton:	writing literary fiction for any medium is not commercially viable
01:37:25	Jennifer Dellner:	@Justin: fascinating question. I have no answer but would love to learn more
01:37:56	Richard Holeton:	making an NFT is far from a guarantee of making any money — it’s a gigantic market
01:40:03	Astrid Ensslin (she/her):	visual novels I guess? Dating simulators?
01:43:25	Deena Larsen:	Mournts for the hypertext hotel!
01:43:51	Deena Larsen:	And we had the first ghost in hypertext--as I forget now who died with her internet connection on.
