WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Oh, I'm. Before you begin, I would like to first record it and then show you the jingle, and then I'll stop screen sharing and you can talk about it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Exactly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay, so can I start recording now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Yes. Yeah. Okay, thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so, um, I'm doing it again. So,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
my god.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes, Michael, you can share the presentation, please because now he's recording.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:42.000
St.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
things.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, Our presentation is neither archaeology, or genealogical approach to Peruvian electronic poetry and.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes. So, this is

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
an invitation that Michael and I do since two years ago.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Because we realized that in our country, there is not much research on the matter, but there are interesting unnecessary work.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And next Michael please.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Okay, sorry there so thoroughly Empire three America trilogy means for us the possibility of understanding a history of poetry, from the influence and relationship of the works with our means of production.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So, that is to change that traditional vision so worth one in which the environment can be defining criteria and not a forgotten on surprise, one for us is like Marshall McLuhan said the medium is the message.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:35.000
What you see is a single Metro halfway mass or five meters of points from night 1927. I work by the Peruvian poet Carlos Kendall and math printed bite me nervous is the on the on the right.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
From Casa godless who your sister, Maria you brothers. This printing machine is responsible for literally mother modernization in Peru.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So it's too important for us to start with this. It's interesting that this printing company has print that or the descent, and abundance hard work, like this one, single McComas that refers to the media everywhere.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Seeing it for it, try to emulate the cellulite of the cinema in a book format, which also has to be surely as personality and interior design movement.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:46.000
His work is important, because Carlos agenda, not only refers to a technological million. He also executives, it's in his work. So this is the beginning for us to our work from the media archaeology.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, this is what our classification has been both built around the medium and his characteristic.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We have called this route from the mechanical muse, to the electronic news. So the llama some mechanical Alamosa electronica.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So we have three pattern is identified by color intensity in our work. So at first you have words that use the computer in the, in the left. Okay, and decide that your jobs that have been created and pro and sold for the computer and also have been created

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:54.000
a and do it for the computer on internet platforms, or on local platforms, so there is two ways from that word from the computer in the middle, you have the pattern that we call works that referred to cybernetics pre computer.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So, here you have a the words that refer to cybernetics throughout the language can be informed on content.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And on the right, you have the pattern words designed for nll media.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.000
These are words created, and sold for another of media that it can be in a printed on paper No.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It means that can be do and paper from another local media or printed machine to see Dr. Michael, the next place.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Okay, so did this vision from the media archaeology, which aims to show an aspect relegate to the poetic tradition for a Peruvian wedding tradition, a set the policy, community of constructing a genealogy, that understand that the history of this works.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.000
A is not linear, is a is different is intelligence.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It also allow us to locate basis on patterns that the characteristic of work that use digital under relation with others experiment, experimentation, a prior to them.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:46.000
We can see that that Peruvian experimental boy tick works from before, to use a computer, or those made in another media breath sent elements that yellow with those that use these technologies.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So, to establish this relationship with the pattern of the media archaeology and the genealogical, we have identified five common patterns. So Michael, can you open please.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The presentation and moral.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, this is a first first aa tried to understand the genealogical a Peruvian media, so we have five.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:27.000
A common patterns that allow organization the following a missile ization effort this realization, in which this is to get them deliveries, our growth together.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Now, neither geology and genealogy. And so, the first pattern we, we, we went to show you is Michael Can you is. Okay, this is the quality.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I said, a circle of grass Yes. So, in this partner, are the works that use be Sweetie, in the space, either on the blank sheet or on that computer interface now so there is what the nice well It also allows them to highlight a condition of movement, so

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
important for the first avant garde experiments.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Okay, there's a lot of works that are influenced by an experimental of avant garde. If we could call them works that explore this like poetry. The other the other name to recognize these words can be also be shy boy.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, an example of this column of movement patterns that exist. it could be between career Solar Warden.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And if you look, there is the, the pattern of this relative but also in in the space and laser and more your years later, there's another similar word from Michael Yotel who is also here, Michael Can you show the part where are your work, where there

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:48.000
is your work. Yes. So, if, if you can see their mental Carla so when Baldwin is has a similar similar patterns, or, or the work of Michael have similar patterns that hunger salute him.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:01.000
This word for my goal is a vocalist for beaten going oh boy Emma, but could be also by will win and everything by wisdom in a, in a point from Michael.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So, in this pattern from Miss Wiley D. You also have a mic.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But also there's a lot of books, Michael Can you open the, the, the presentation for because we went to see the others.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So yes, Michael and I are not the only one. So you have a also in the visual pattern, you have cancer can go and Matt. Can you show the, the first migraine.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:42.000
See, is the murder four year scholarship endo and math. Okay, then. Next, a California Matt is from 1927.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And then you got to have your solo good in 1977. And then you have.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Michael if you want, you can move closer water

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:12.000
from the work, Rosa, or rose from 2006, then you have coziness your Lopez. That is a, is a rescue from, from a migraine that he rescued this work for mlm house.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
See,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Maybe you, you are showing my presentation for themselves.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Okay, just one person's account list, and then you you have Michael.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Okay. A. Also, you have a Enrique bail metaverse was initially did this is a work that is made him with an earlier them into. No, I don't remember how you set it up into English my good reality.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Reality Augmented augmented reality, augmented reality, this, This word is a real mental mental reality. A. You can play this with your cell phone. So you find bombs in, you can find points in the reality where there is a sort of a sudden video.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Okay thanks Mike, please return to the personalization.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So, that was the first butter, we, we can identify, then we got the stick of butter in this is the allergy.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And that is the media. Okay, this, this partner shows that works that in their construction show an awareness of means of production of stand up.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:51.000
This means that they are there are points or are this with works in which the media needs, use of part of their meaning know it.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
For example, this is the media and so you have there.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Again girls again the mat. It has to record Horace key, there is a Buddha Casa water beta Gloria humaneness Rafael Garcia was it Ambien and recover it and then also to and recover.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000
So, an interesting example can be a, the one carried out by forgetful Roski and night.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:45.000
1964, with a nickel and can meet.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:14:07.000
with a computer. And that same operation with code ASCII I'm Boudicca is carried out or was the same or similar operation, it is carried out by Berra and girlish humans with the work that his name in English is not the naming a Spanish modify printing

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And, 2020, and 80, and 89, in which they modified a matrix printer to print, but this.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
OK, so the the top butter.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Is that a scenario he knows.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
If you can see my going to charity. Yes. So, In this pattern.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Here are the words that privilege, the sound dimension integration and use recording a programming or artificial intelligence for their Realization.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:14.000
This is a case of for example, in 1972, one go agent some and recorded on a tape callers a piece in which the names of the colors are harmonically repeat, Michael, as you can open the colors, maybe.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Yo, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie yo.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
where are they.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Where are they.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Where are they.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Very good.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Okay.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So cola for Nagel sunset and repeat a yellow, green, red and blue and different sounds.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So, similar and work. It could be with programming, a barbell from my goal migrating you open barbell.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So, in this work.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:29.000
My good, but my bed is, which is the some dimension appears when we interact with that interface. If you can interact manga.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
ma,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
saying, saying.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So, Tom.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Robin, Ma.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Hey, go, Jim.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Like Aaliyah ran, ran.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Thanks, Mike.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Thanks.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So, in that part time. It's also, in other words, from our leftovers, that it's a word that it's and takes some parts of CT Hagen son is done with artificial intelligence, this, and Michael Can you open a presentation to see.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So you have Michael.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Yes and No it's not. It's the open the presentation is not.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Okay. and you also have a national office. Okay. Well, the, the 45 mark.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Thanks, East hypertext.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:57.000
The fourth pattern in hypertext, and here that highlight the words that are based on Lincoln's of data, or from quotes, or link.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Okay. An example of this is quite a meaningful ways in via potato.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
This is analogous media is, is think until for the paper in 1978.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I work in which the links between the birth are established by number.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Yes. In the same way, militia for later in the last year.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:39.000
We just got four ladies here with us class at this our words oyster for us, a work related with collaborative in voice to text and hyperlinks.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Okay, there's not a lot much time for me so I'm going to the fifth. the fifth pattern, please.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I'm taking note of the fifth pattern, thanks for better. These are words that use mathematical operations to from the same elements points create other basic forms, see the permutation and.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.000
An example of this is it with her for God willing, and some.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:25.000
An example of this is with Jorge guard Williamson, again, who in 1950 had a permutations in the poems. Variations around the glass of water, no. Oh, but yes yeah Nessun Dorma and bustle of the hour.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000
If you make a migraine from my finished and done and bustle Yeah.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You can see the permutation.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
In that point.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So it says, it must be minus he doing the slaves now, and can be the glass of water in my hands and doing my legs.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:59.000
My, my hands in the glass of water, and my lips on you. The glass of water in my lips and doing my hand, my lips in my hands, and you on the glass of water.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:16.000
So, these are words that means fermentation. And there is a similar operation in 2006, with a rose. Also, the cassava, in this work.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The word rose, or Lawson spaniel place with its vibration and Spanish. So, if you make up a ratio with rose, you, you can have. You can have a little work, and in Spanish is Rosa, or was it.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.000
No. That can means a flower the roast but also that touch, no roof or sad.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Okay, so I'm going to finish here. So, as you can see, there's a lot of information that has not yet been up, but I want to rescue that possibility of having generating an order it.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:05.000
This is an energy, and also is important, in the sense of woman here.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
If you see all the presentation. There is a movement.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And we did not intend to point a direct influence of the analytical help with the digital ones, but with the, with the one is a, identify the similar patterns that electronic and digital convert into realization in the initial experiments, so it's not

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:53.000
influence is, it's the patterns that are present in all the program for a particular edition. So, next is going to continue my good, and we show you a map of the revision electronic and digital poetry, a data visualization, and also Michael will explain

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:05.000
our work, because this MIT Media technology and genealogy is not a show in this is also to rescue and restore these pieces.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:16.000
We have called this transcoding water and scope. Because when we rest, we will. When we restaurant we also create a modified everything at work.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And then finally, at meals.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
She's a researcher.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And also, he's an artist and show us the last part of this genealogy, what young people in Peru is doing right now with digital poetry and electric electric poetry too.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Thanks.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Michael.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Thanks.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Okay, Sam I

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
want to speak in Spanish, sorry.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Okay.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Okay.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
When a barista parte de la mesa.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Boy you represented lays Rock Cafe, the illness plateaus Politico's esk.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Where are you, Sarah Largo, the almost the stick with the manual,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000
when they're finished it yesterday.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Okay, a keynote Come in Sir, can master list areas can also throws Amazonia in Quantico.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And at this point the customers thorough.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:15.000
A the poster material for the most are the most a category is a particular person material is alien, a software proprietary to a crazy suffer cat, no computer aided design.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000
He said, I gotta react case, a redemption, especially context or Latin America, no.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
A entices me.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Me Charla MacArthur, who's the mentor Sorel no context or Latin America knows you know the context of I wanna get some context to his distinctive were given contrast.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:52.000
In order for him block again category animals, no cinemas over as a strong interest in flesh, Jonas, just in weeks.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
He maintains his departure, they may or legitimately.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
A Giro party coming up into a while every Sarah.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.000
El Camino para facility was your authority on the business, the interplay he died, he died.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:21.000
But he didn't direct on the rest of illustrate the historically Say bye bye Denzel will be SS. A.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
It was a continuation.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Okay, that's it. She based on the kimono for a pie suck a documented Osama Quinta the lessons here they will respect through this DC minute he talus will get us into His do quit.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:57.000
He gave her a complaint there level of awareness into UCC to eliminate those ethical sistema in a desire to create our own autonomy and then those are by something called the remote areas, but it's a yes or yes, but it possibly Tony goes to India some

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:11.000
co sales materials from sales. Yes, he come with a specimen as he della della della that according to me smokiness or so later today he tell you.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
the qualification manipulation edition

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000
imposes a and it gets up at one or photos and control most basic and then they overlap strangle remaining in that category.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000

Thanks, my God.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Now we continue with me Luca

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Luca, I Young Artist some employed.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Hi.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Oh, no. One second.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Okay.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Hi, my name is minister phonetic is a Franca an art student specializing in painting of the quantity scenarios Agatha DiCaprio, and these opportunity I will talk about my thesis project in which I will explain the concept that I've been developing in

00:43:47.000 --> 00:44:07.000
the name of the project is pulling that IP 232 dot 199 dot one dot one eight, and it's where I seek to create an electronic hyper textual poetry, visual and practice as an instrument of connection.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:26.000
So the topic is starts from the electronic literature and focus on social networks connectivity and interaction between the writer and the reader, as well as the interaction over poetry to recognize this poetry as well as as an action that tries to shape

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000
the world, and creates during the process, nurturing the final product.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:46.000
So, for me, that has changed as a result of these new interactions on the internet. The approach and the means of communications as well.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:57.000
There are moments in which the relevance of disconnection brings us closer, when geography distance and time or space in us from each other. and then a question comes up.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Why don't we believe in our visual reformatted and electronic poetry and allow us to connect through hyperlinks when bodies are not no longer there.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I protect offers possibilities of keeping the community close, as well as directly, encouraging others to participate.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000
The goal is to allow the other to reflect to be encouraged to create changes from the point to establish an interaction and connection between the writer and the reader.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:39.000
As I said before, and consolidate reconciling or treat as a method with skills to modify reality.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Here are some concepts and keywords from which I start to make the interplay and send this as a process as a reflection, but also as a critique, to the activism.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I got a

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
or initiative of the reader to dive into the.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:23.000
The reinterpretation of the poetry from the image, as in the case of the hologram that's very seven cetera this reflection reflection convert on the languages, by which I wanted to develop the project, such as I believe web page video poetry.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:37.000
The project main resource of circulation is the Instagram account Belinda in which there will be points using the resources proposed by electronically transfer.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Every one of the points will speak from a personal and community view where the participation of the other is always relevant.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:59.000
And the topics are extracted from the current situation such as Corbett pandemic context, and there is always the possibility of collaborative poetry.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:08.000
So, the file the process is kind of also the essence of the of my thesis and when in.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:27.000
In, when Instagram interactions are used the most. And one other external resources are utilized besides social networks, the artistic part of its process will have a link, whether acting to the website.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:35.000
So the blue circle in the deployments, as a wordplay among internet in ourselves and interdisciplinary.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:55.000
and as they are points that deal with their context with particular at that point, we read it as an as an action and interaction.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:18.000
So there are seven employments on the resources as I said before, now sharing material from users and my own creation, the Instagram stories and highlights stories are acts as a notification and also, as I said before file and.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:35.000
So the conclusion is that is that the intention of the process to be seen is for the constant inspection from others, and the interaction that occurs between them.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:45.000
So here the first employment is by month so I sorta. It was work with Google Drive application in a Word document.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And here is to let the other Philly interact with the text, the option to come in and edit inside a file it's always available, and the general subject is the recent current time and virus, and there's a static pattern, the hyperlinks inside the boom,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:18.000
which weather access, either way to an image or a song, or maybe another point.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
The next one is in there by Matt for gold editor.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:36.000
And here comply videos which I personally saw as an avid. The point blends with the image and sounds equates around inside reflects a private share unveil.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000
I asked the followers to share their own editor, which with a video or a photo. As a result, all their video.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Cole, other additives was created the interaction here are the new are similar meanings. Now the other individuals decide to reveal the boys is enough that our peers are from some of my friends in order to generate less monotonous so

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:19.000
I'm going to show some of these interviews in the end. And I just continue with the presentation and then I'm going to show you some of them.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Okay, here in Alabama say so, as Mr. Boom boom The sound of the words, while being redone is what has the protectionism, the Sounders poetry's a new language that is created, I use as Mr as a sensory response, in which the person feel satisfaction listening

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:50.000
to the sounds.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:01.000
And again to make live, to make the sound less monotonous. I apply all their coats and language.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Then it's a boy. Yet this seven processes the employment process of a form.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
It uses vj by editor for its interpretation and presentation.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
In a link.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:30.000
And if they come from procedure or poetry, you give them the machine variables and commands, and it responds, making the product.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Okay. The word cyber boom in which words are gravitating in a spot.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:55.000
The instructions are not only in the Instagram post but also on the same page, assemble your point is the permanent suggestion to make the to make the drawing the curses is use the brush, brush creates a live in Mark, where the phrase, you are the point,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:07.000
point, which gives the user the possibility of being part of the action of the Interpol.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Okay, in our, in our buildings.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Here the link sprayed another language directly from communication from WhatsApp app, which are something like Telecom, for example, they are other links that are considered a strong ties in your social practices, where we can jump from one reality to

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:43.000
another. So images sounds awards. This one is blend between the virtual unsentimental, so there is no linear logic that allows us to perform only one way of portrayed a new conversation.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Several.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:53:08.000
These are conversations, I asked three friends to make a short story in which we just play with words and images and songs, The difference between our kind of normal conversations are the words will be involved

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:21.000
here some of the parts of the conversation again I will show some of these are at the end.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Okay, dad is upset this in interpolate one nine.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Um, it was on video arts animation stop motion. So it started with a conversation with the follower about the object that they are the best friends.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:54.000
And I asked them to take a photo of the object, and they kind of tell me the story behind it. And why is important. As a result of the conversation I create a point that also includes the keywords that they express the video.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I'm sorry the posing questions following the video, and the process the result and, as well as the interaction is documented in the highlights stories.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
So,

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:35.000
when I like kind of post these videos that I made. I also asked the followers, like what they think about the object that they have seen in that video.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:53.000
And, in which, like, they kind of react and make a choice of what is the object for them in order to make others assumptions and wait, kind of haikus from their answers.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And this is also in the highlight stories.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:13.000
So finally, the last one is probably going to have five members of my family and friends to draw drawing on one with friends or something possible, and the other two something impossible.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
it may or not be.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:32.000
It may or not may not be related to the current situation. And on the other hand to write two sentences one related to your payment me life. And another during the pandemic, it didn't have to be related to your drawing.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:53.000
we face in Peru. Last November because of government. I also choose to ask for opinions in one sentence for that means for sensitive people, which is that age of means that, luckily my sister was an admin so as a mother how they felt on the marches the

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:01.000
changes and the injustice that arose.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:17.000
So I create a game in which the players Tuesday matches the pictures and connect them with the sentences that I have to create using only the words that they have written to me with family, friends and acquaintances.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:36.000
This edited vs are hidden in the images, such as we're here, here, and in this way is a kind of exclusive corpse that is created in which the boy is not only reading words, but in pictures, where a new random interplay was created every time they played

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.000
is kind of a performative act per se from the quality.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
It's proposed to connect you writer with experienced from the others as well.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Also the results that are share are in the highlights stories.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
So here is like how it works.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:14.000
What I'm trying to generate with this interplay of myself feeling of belonging, on behalf of the user. And the tongue touching myself from the poem queda resistant to the situation that is handled from empathy and constant communication with the other.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:24.000
If the user does not generate any interaction points not complete, since their participation is expected to be part of the final product.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:41.000
The Creator for hypertext detaches himself from his own creation after providing the other with the path of spaces, through which the text is Director, director, but it's the reader for this is the path.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000
So, as a tiny conclusion.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:58:01.000
I actually consider this project is an open door for interdisciplinary teams between new languages of poetry itself, as well as the different ways of creating images, it's an initiative for personal development in the visual effects, as well as for the

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:18.000
others will delve into these issues in the near future. The Belinda count exist to share and interact with viewers, and at the same time, extend what has been learned as an open dialogue, by tree has a universal meaning and it's necessary to joining not

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:30.000
only with those who were involved in the matter, but those who seek to understand themselves and their environment in a different way. Hopefully I will contribute to that course.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
So now, really, really quick.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:47.000
I want to show you some of these employments that are here. I don't know if you can see my page, I think you do. If not tell me

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
scream. Sorry.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000
So, this one is the one that Michael amber mill talked about,

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:04.000
which you can click here and there's a hyperlink there were there were sown in this case.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Then this one it's called a retired in.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Let's see. Cynthia, Tony clinical Olivia.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Leopard a sucker for us

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
with us.

00:59:40.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Nice brokers Western system.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:18.000
This one is from us. I'm just take a moment to wait a little to the target. Here are the other words that have been doing.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
This one is they put a link below.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:39.000
This is like a video in which I kind of show them how you can kind of read one of the possibilities of how you can read this.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And this one is

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
greater.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So you here first, cause of disease and when you explain, explain that this is an interplay of money you are part of the process. And they you sell like like between two 116 images,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
like for example this.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And then you go and start, and it gives you a kind of a collage, and then you could show them and it shows you the boy, I only use, as I said before, the words that they have give me given me and it kind of.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I don't know that's really fun doing this.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And this one I can.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Well, it was this one, I don't know why he can enter. I think I put it Well, sorry.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Okay, this one.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And that's,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I think that's it.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Thank you,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
as well.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So I left, I have questions I wish we had more time.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Yes, I know.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Oh gosh. Yeah. So thank you, Melinda for your wonderful work I'm, thank you for introducing that to me.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I'm Pamela, please can you talk to me about maybe doing an exhibition for the next with all of that work it's a fabulous. Michael you too. But Michael the flash work you're doing are you trying conifer at all.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Are you using that with any success. Success Have you tried it.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's also free.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Mike, would you like that but I want to see the other films that have gone effed up Ambien.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
No, no, no.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Is that we thought we had a hard time with rafal we ran the 48 works for the exhibition through rafal first about 20 of them worked, but the links deprecating.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So we had to run them through rafal again.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And we found the sound in videos were to a lot of the words were too complex ruffle ruffle likes really flat websites.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And mostly was not is the school is showing it's just too rich for rafal.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So we ended up having to use conifer.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And that was a lot better so.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
