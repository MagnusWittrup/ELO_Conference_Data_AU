00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.880
Pamela Medina: Things.

4
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.710
Pamela Medina: Well, our presentation is meter geology a genealogical approach to Peruvian electronic poetry and.

5
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.280
Pamela Medina: Yes, so this is.

6
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.970
Pamela Medina: An initiation that Michael and I do since two years ago.

7
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:20.940
Pamela Medina: is important because we we we have carrie up with my question to you, so these are objective is to raise or find the antecedents of the ruin electronic and you know the poetry.

8
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:32.010
Pamela Medina: Because we realize that in our country, there is not much research on the matter, but there are interesting unnecessary work and next, my goodness.

9
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.220
Pamela Medina: Okay.

10
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.780
Pamela Medina: As readers of beryllium poetry.

11
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:53.670
Pamela Medina: amelia archaeology means for us the possibility of understanding, a history of the region poetry from that influence and relationship of the works with their means of production as technology.

12
00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:06.870
Pamela Medina: That is to change that traditional visions, or worse, one in which the environment can be defining pretty around and not offer good end on surprise one.

13
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:30.420
Pamela Medina: For us, is like Marshall McLuhan said the median is a message what you see is a single metal halfway mass or five meters of points from night 1927 I work by the Peruvian poet Carlos can do math printed by a the Minerva he's.

14
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:44.100
Pamela Medina: On the on the right from Casa godless and Julio CESAR Maria Thank you brothers this printed machine is responsible for alliterative mother modernization in Peru.

15
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:57.090
Pamela Medina: So it's too important for us to start with this it's interesting that this printing company has printed or producer an avant garde work like this one.

16
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:08.130
Pamela Medina: A single method that refers to that medium everywhere sing it for it, try to emulate that cellulite of the cinema.

17
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:29.820
Pamela Medina: In a book format and which also has be surely T as personality and interior design movement a his work is important because colossal can not only refers to a technological million, he also executive it's in his work, so this is our.

18
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.540
Pamela Medina: A the beginning for us to our work from the media, archaeology and see under my good perfect.

19
00:03:44.820 --> 00:04:00.780
Pamela Medina: Okay, so this is why our classification has been built built around the median and his characteristic, we have called this route from the mechanic i'm used to the electronic i'm use.

20
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:19.980
Pamela Medina: Some mechanical alamosa electronica so we have three a pattern is identified by color density in our work so first you have works that use the computer in the.

21
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:32.910
Pamela Medina: In the Left Okay, and these are the jobs that have been created and true and soap for the computer and also have been created a.

22
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:44.910
Pamela Medina: And do it for a computer on Internet platforms are and look I platforms, so there is two ways, a friend that works from the computer in the middle.

23
00:04:45.420 --> 00:05:02.970
Pamela Medina: You have the pattern, and that we call words that refer to cybernetics free computer so here you have a that works that referred to cybernetics throughout the language, it can be informed on content.

24
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:29.640
Pamela Medina: And on the right, and you have the pattern works designed for analog media this works created and sold for nll of media that a can be in a printed on paper, not as a It means that can be do an in paper from another local media or printed machine.

25
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:40.740
Pamela Medina: At the end i'll see to make the next place Okay, so do this vision from the media, archaeology.

26
00:05:41.490 --> 00:06:01.380
Pamela Medina: which aims to show an aspect relegate to the poetic tradition from a Peruvian weighty tradition, a he said, the reality of constructing a genealogy that understand that the history of this works, a is not linear.

27
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.180
Pamela Medina: Is a is different, is it origins.

28
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:24.900
Pamela Medina: It also allow us to locate based on patterns and that the characteristic of work that use digital under relation with others experiment experimentation a prior to them.

29
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:40.080
Pamela Medina: We can see there that there will be an experimental poetic works from before, to use a computer or those made in another media percent elements that yellow.

30
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:58.020
Pamela Medina: With those that a use these technologies so to establish this relationship with a pattern of the meteorology and the genealogical and we have identified five common pattern so Michael can you open, please.

31
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.450
Pamela Medina: The presentation and moral.

32
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:12.930
Pamela Medina: So this is our first first a a try to understand the genealogical a Peruvian media, so we have a five.

33
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:40.410
Pamela Medina: A common patterns that allow organization, the following a visualization of fertilization, in which this a two categories are brought together now meteorology and genealogy, and so the first pattern we we we want to show you establish society Mike what can U s Okay, this is actually.

34
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.390
Pamela Medina: A circle a circle, yes, yes, so.

35
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:57.270
Pamela Medina: In this potter a are the words that use the society in the space a either on the blank sheet.

36
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:11.730
Pamela Medina: or on that particular interface, and also a, there is the visibility also allows them to highlight a condition of movement so important for the first avant garde experiments.

37
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:24.660
Pamela Medina: Okay there's a lot of works that are influenced by experiments of avant garde if we could call them works that explore this write poetry, the other.

38
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:40.890
Pamela Medina: The other name to to recognize this work can be also be shy poetry, so an example of this come up movement patterns that exist, it could be between career followed him.

39
00:08:41.310 --> 00:09:10.320
Pamela Medina: A police Michael in clever solution and 1970s 77 and the the work of so luda was been to the vocalists in English is a by wind and, if you look, there is the the pattern of equality, but also in in the space and later and.

40
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:26.160
Pamela Medina: More years later there's an another similar work from Michael hotel is also here, Michael can you show the part where are your work where there is your work.

41
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:44.970
Pamela Medina: Yes, so if if if you can see there a mentor guide so when bar with his class and semi similar patterns or or the work of Michael have similar patterns that have your solution.

42
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:54.300
Pamela Medina: Is this word for my goal is a book Alice or be tando in employment, but could be also and.

43
00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:08.640
Pamela Medina: By will win and retain my wisdom in a in a point from my code, so in this pattern from mutuality you also has a MIC and but also there's a lot of points Michael can you.

44
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:27.630
Pamela Medina: Open the the the presentation for because we went to see the others So yes, my goal and hybrid solution or not the only one, so you have a also in the obituary pattern, you have colossal Kendall and matt can you show the the first migrant.

45
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:47.640
Pamela Medina: See is in order, for years, with no i'm not Okay, then next a classic and matt is from 1927 and then you got to have your solo during 1977 and then you have and.

46
00:10:48.120 --> 00:11:12.780
Pamela Medina: Michael if you want, you can move because her water no a from a work Rosa or rose know from 2006, then you have cause a NASA Lopez, that is a is a rescue from from my goal that he rescued this work for Mr Williams house see if.

47
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:35.880
Pamela Medina: Maybe you, you are showing my presentation from my mom's house okay just whenever a person doesn't list, and then you have Michael Okay, a also you have a Enrique bare metal scene visually did this is a work that is made him with.

48
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:45.990
Pamela Medina: And earlier them into know and I don't remember how you separate them into English my reality reality augmented.

49
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.390
Michael Hurtado: reality.

50
00:11:49.860 --> 00:12:07.620
Pamela Medina: augmented reality this this word is a real your mental mental reality, a you can play this with your cell phone, so you find poems in you can find points in the reality, whether it's a.

51
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.670
Pamela Medina: it's a sad video okay thanks Michael please return to the presentation.

52
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:25.380
Pamela Medina: So that was the first butter we we can you identify, then we got the second butter in this analogy and.

53
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:38.010
Pamela Medina: There is the media okay this this fatter shows that works that in their construction show an awareness of means of production, a standout.

54
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:46.650
Pamela Medina: This means that they are there for it or artist with works in which the media it and its use of part.

55
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.970
Perla Sasson-Henry: of their meaning now.

56
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.880
Pamela Medina: For example, this is the media and also you have there.

57
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.160
Pamela Medina: Again again.

58
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:10.770
Pamela Medina: It has to record hurrah ski there is a war Casa would be likely humaneness referral Garcia, was it ambient emmerich avail OK, and then also to and recover so.

59
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:25.770
Pamela Medina: An interesting example can be a the one carried out by for Gil kerlikowske and I am 1964 with a NICO and kavita and artists.

60
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:39.390
Pamela Medina: In 1974 who construct words from the the yellow and use with an electronic medium a husky has an electronic see good in her collection of poems.

61
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:53.400
Pamela Medina: umberger a uses modifies pieces and with a computer that same operation with courtesy and Buddha is carried out or less the same or similar operation is.

62
00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:08.190
Pamela Medina: carried out by berra and got a few minutes, with the work that his name in English is not the naming Spanish modified printing machine in 2020 19.

63
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:17.340
Pamela Medina: And 20 and 89 and in which they modified a matrix printer to print boyd thesis.

64
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.530
Pamela Medina: OK, so the the top butter.

65
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.870
Pamela Medina: Is that a celebrity knows.

66
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.170
Pamela Medina: If you can see my going to narrate it yes so.

67
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:46.560
Pamela Medina: In this pattern here are the words that revelation the sound dimension, integration and us regarding a programming or artificial intelligence for the.

68
00:14:47.730 --> 00:15:07.950
Pamela Medina: recession, if this is a case of, for example in 1972 called Hillary Williamson and record it on a tape colors appeasing which the names of the colors are harmonically repeat now like good if you can open the colors maybe.

69
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:29.760
you're very you're very you're very you're very you're very you're very you're very you're Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria Maria.

Okay.

73
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:58.650
Pamela Medina: So Carla for nagel sunset and repeat a yellow green red and blue and different sounds so a similar work, it could be with programming a barbell.

74
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.640
Pamela Medina: From Michael Michael can you open Bobby.

75
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:20.280

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:22.200
Pamela Medina: So, and in in in that pattern is it's also a other words from our motto is that it's a work that it's and takes some parts of curtail some is done with artificial intelligence this and making you up in a presentation.

88
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:23.970
Pamela Medina: To see.

89
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.920
Pamela Medina: And I see you have my power letter s and no it's not it's the open the presentation is not.

90
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.070
Pamela Medina: Okay, and you also has a housing national office Okay, what the the fourth fighter.

91
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.880
Pamela Medina: Thanks is hypertext.

92
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:55.680
Pamela Medina: The first pattern in hypertext and here that highlight the words that are based on Lincoln of data or from quotes or link.

93
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:17.280
Pamela Medina: Okay, an example of this is quantum universities in beta beta a this is analogous made media is is think until for the paper in 1978 I work in which the links between the birds are established by number.

94
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:27.270
Pamela Medina: Yes, in the same way middle school for later in the last year, we just have hilarious here with us a class.

95
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:43.950
Pamela Medina: At this hour or so, for us, our work, created a with collaborative in very true takes on hyperlinks okay there's not a lot much time for me so i'm going to.

96
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:57.510
Pamela Medina: The fifth the fifth pattern, please because i'm taking a lot of times the fifth better thanks the for better These are words that use mathematical operations.

97
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:12.870
Pamela Medina: To from the same elements to the points create other poetic firms see the permutation and an example of this is a with her headway in some or a again for people they get some.

98
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:29.850
Pamela Medina: Who in 1950 had a permutations in the poems variations around the glass of water or buy a car is under number, so if you make assume my goal from media Center Center number so.

99
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.330
Pamela Medina: You can see the permutation.

100
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.220
Pamela Medina: In that poem.

101
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:49.680
Pamela Medina: Now, so it says it musalia women minus 20 Slavia snow and can be a glass of water in my hands and doing my a my my hands in the glass of water and my lips on you.

102
00:19:50.220 --> 00:20:11.940
Pamela Medina: The glass of water in my lips, and doing my hand my lips in my hands and you on the glass of water So these are words that means fermentation and there is a similar operation in 2006 with a rose or offer they conserve water.

103
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.250
Pamela Medina: In this work.

104
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:38.580
Pamela Medina: The word rose or Ross and expand your place with its vibration and Spanish So if you make up a ratio with rose, you can have you can have another little work in in Spanish is Rosa Rosa now if that can means a flower the Rose but also that touch now rob said.

105
00:20:39.870 --> 00:21:01.770
Pamela Medina: Okay, so i'm going to finish here so as you can see there's a lot of information that has not yet been up, but I want to rescue that possibility of having generating an order a, this is an energy and also is important in the process of woman here.

106
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:09.150
Pamela Medina: If you see all the presentation, there is a woman.

107
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:19.170
Pamela Medina: And with we did not intend to point a direct influence of the analytical holders, with the digital ones, but.

108
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:30.690
Pamela Medina: We do with the one is a identified that similar patterns that electronic and digital convert into realization in the initial experiments so.

109
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:39.210
Pamela Medina: it's not that influence is it's the pattern, there are present in all the program for a poetic tradition.

110
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:49.470
Pamela Medina: So next is going to continue my goal and we show you a map of the Roman electronic and digital poetry a data visualization.

111
00:21:49.770 --> 00:22:03.810
Pamela Medina: And also, Michael will explain our work, because it this meat media technology and genealogy is not a show in this is also to rescue and restore these pieces.

112
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:17.460
Pamela Medina: We have called this transcoding or trans code, because when we rest we will, when we restaurant, we also create and modify the original work and then finally at me liska.

113
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:34.170
Pamela Medina: she's a researcher and also he's an artist and show us the last part of this genealogy what young people in Peru is doing right now with digital poetry electric electric poetry too thanks.

114
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:36.960

Miluska Falero Casafranca: So the topic is starts from the electronic literature and focus on social networks connectivity and interaction.

266
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:30.480
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Between the writer and the reader as well as the interaction over the poetry to recognize this poetry, as well as as as an action that tries to shape the world and creates during the process nurturing the final product.

267
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:44.580
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So for me that externality has changed as a result of these new interactions on the Internet, the approach and the means of communications as well.

268
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:53.910
Miluska Falero Casafranca: There are moments in which the relevance of disconnection brings us closer when geography distance and time our spacing us from each other.

269
00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:08.010
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And then, a question comes up why don't we believe in a visual reformatted and electronic poetry and allow us to connect through hyperlinks when bodies are not longer there I protects offers possibilities of keeping the Community.

270
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.150
Miluska Falero Casafranca: As well as directly encouraging others to participate.

271
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:34.800
Miluska Falero Casafranca: The goal is to allow the other to reflect to be encouraged to create changes from the point to establish an interaction and connection between the writer and the reader, as I said before, and consolidate we can silence poetry as a method with skills modify reality.

272
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:52.410
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Here are some concepts and keywords from which I start to make the interplay of sin this as a process as a reflection, but also as a critique to the activism I got a.

273
00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:06.540
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Little a mission initiative of the reader to dive into the for their reinterpretation of the poetry from the image, as in the case of the kilogram that's very soon cetera.

274
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:17.940
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And these reflections reflection convert on the languages, by which I wanted to develop the project such as I bullying web page video poetry.

275
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:34.590
Miluska Falero Casafranca: The project main resource circulation is the instagram account Linda in which there will be points, using the resources proposed by electronic gadgets for.

276
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:52.860
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Every one of the points will speak for my personal and Community view, where the participation of the other is always relevant and the topics are extracted from the current situation, such as carbon endemic context and there is always a possibility of.

277
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.560
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Collaborative poetry.

278
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.280
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So the file, the process is kind of also the essence.

279
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:20.820
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Of My thesis in when in in when instagram interactions are used the most and one other external resources are utilized besides social networks, the artistic part of its process will have a link resurrecting to the website.

280
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:33.270
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So the blooms are called into deployments as a wordplay among Internet in ourself an interdisciplinary team.

281
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:48.990
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And, as they are points that deal with their context with particular at the upon be read it as an as an action and interaction it in the deployment are oncoming of interventions between readers and writers.

282
00:47:54.690 --> 00:48:06.360
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So there are seven interplay moments, and the resources, as I said before that sharing material from users and my own creation, the instagram stories and highlight stories are.

283
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:12.180
Miluska Falero Casafranca: acts as a notification and also, as I said before, file and natural.

284
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:13.980
Miluska Falero Casafranca: and

285
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:28.260
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So, the conclusion is that is that the intention of the process to be seen, is for the consent inspection from others, and the interaction there, of course, between them.

286
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.230
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So here, the first employment is.

287
00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:45.660
Miluska Falero Casafranca: That up by month or so I sorta it was work with Google drive application in a word, document and here.

288
00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:54.480
Miluska Falero Casafranca: If to let the other fully interact with the text, the option to come in and Edit inside the file is always available.

289
00:48:55.140 --> 00:49:09.360
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And the general subject is the recent current time and virus and satanic pattern the hyperlinks inside the poem which whether accents either way to an image or a song or maybe another porn.

290
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:33.510
Miluska Falero Casafranca: The next one is in their appointment for called Avatar and here are comply videos which I personally saw as an avid the point blends with image and sounds to create surrounding sad reflects a private share unveil.

297
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:22.260
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Then it's a boy theater seven processor employment process of a poem it uses reject by editor for its interpretation and presentation in a link and it's taken from procedural poetry you get the machine variables and commands and it responds, making the product.

298
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:44.100

302
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:31.020
Miluska Falero Casafranca: They are other links that are considered a strong ties in social practices, where we can jump from one reality to another.

303
00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:43.050
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Images sounds awards, this one is blend between the virtual unsentimental, so there is no linear logic that allows us to form only one way of portraying a new conversation at several.

304
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:45.720
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Of these.

305
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:57.240
Miluska Falero Casafranca: conversations I asked three friends to make a short story in which we just play with words and in between songs the difference between.

310
00:53:51.720 --> 00:54:03.300
Miluska Falero Casafranca: The video i'm sorry the Paulson questions, following the video and the process, the result and as well as the interaction is documented and highlights stories.

311
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:18.600
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So.

312
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:22.260

313
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:34.980
Miluska Falero Casafranca: I like kind of post these videos that I made I also asked the followers like what they think about the object that they have seen in that video and.

Miluska Falero Casafranca: From their answers, and this is also in the highlights stories me.

316
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.920
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So, finally, the last one is a boy that's where interplay my five.

317
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.840
Miluska Falero Casafranca: members of my family and friends to each drag to join.

318
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:18.810
Miluska Falero Casafranca: One referring to something possible and the other two something impossible, it may or not, be it may or not may not be related to the current situation.

319
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:29.340
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And on the other hand, to write two sentences one related to your prevent damage life and another door independent it didn't have to be related to your drone.

320
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:48.570
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And to the political crisis that we face in Peru, last November, because of any government, I also choose to ask for opinions in one sentence for that means for sensitive people, which is a feature of means that, luckily my sister was an admin so.

321
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:55.230
Miluska Falero Casafranca: I haven't about how they felt from the Marches the changes and the justice that arose.

322
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.360
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So.

323
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:12.090
Miluska Falero Casafranca: I create a game in which the players choose the images the pictures and connect them with the sentences that I have great using only the words they have written to me.

324
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:20.430
Miluska Falero Casafranca: With family, friends and acquaintances this edited versus are hidden in the images, such as well here.

325
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:38.340
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Here, and this way is a kind of exquisite corpse that is created in which the boy is not only read in words but in pictures were a new random interruption is created, every time they played is kind of a performative act per se from brutality.

326
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:50.820
Miluska Falero Casafranca: It proposed to connect the writer, we have experienced from the others as well, also the results that are share are in the highlights stories.

327
00:56:52.680 --> 00:57:02.130
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So here is like how it works what i'm trying to generate with this interplay of myself feeling of belonging, on behalf of the user.

328
00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:12.000
Miluska Falero Casafranca: And the chat be touching myself from the poem queda resistant to the situation that is handled from empathy and constant communication with the other.

329
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:29.160
Miluska Falero Casafranca: If the user does not generate an interaction before it's not complete, since their participation is expected to be part of the final product i'm the Creator, for I protect the touches himself from his own creation after providing the other with the path.

330
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:37.680
Miluska Falero Casafranca: Of spaces, through which the text is directed by record but it's the reader to the size, the path.

331
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:52.560
Miluska Falero Casafranca: So as a tiny conclusion um I actually consider this project as an open door for interdisciplinary teams between new languages of poetry itself.

332
00:57:52.980 --> 00:58:02.910
Miluska Falero Casafranca: As well as the different ways of creating images it's an initiative for personal development in the visual analytics as well as for the others who fell into these issues in the near future.

333
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:10.710
Miluska Falero Casafranca: The blimp account access to share and interact with viewers and at the same time, extend what has been learned.

334
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:28.560
Miluska Falero Casafranca: As an open dialogue poetry has any universal meaning and it's necessary to join a not only with those who are involved in the matter, but those who seek to understand themselves and their environment in a different way, hopefully, I will contribute to that because.

335
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.890
Miluska Falero Casafranca: The now really, really quick.

336
