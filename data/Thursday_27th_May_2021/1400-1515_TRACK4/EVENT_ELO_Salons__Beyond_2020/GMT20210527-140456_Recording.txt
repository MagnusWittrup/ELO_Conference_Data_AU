00:08:01	Track Four: Conference Admin:	can I share the jingle now?
00:09:17	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	;)
00:09:45	Hannah Ackermans:	https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86123813202?pwd=Z0szMHZmeVkwd0ZlcGx1YUNsN09qdz09
00:10:50	Track Four: Conference Admin:	the jingle works
00:11:44	Track Four: Conference Admin:	yes
00:12:18	Hannah Ackermans:	URLs to the recordings are added to the ELMCIP records of the salons: https://elmcip.net/event/elo-virtual-salons
00:19:06	Caitlin Fisher:	I don’t think we generally have more than a dozen participants, except for the book launches ;)
00:20:28	Caitlin Fisher:	I’ll say, too, that the York zoom link is available for other organizers - it has auto record, can be started any time and doesn’t require me to be there ;)
00:20:55	Jules Chatelain:	Thank you for clarifying Caitlin - I'm one of the people who due to day commitments only comes to book launches. So there are others like me!
00:26:26	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Wordhack is awesome-o!
00:26:40	Johannah Rodgers:	WordHack is great and it is hosted on Twitch.
00:26:41	Hannah Ackermans:	Wordhack, like the anthology?
00:27:22	Caitlin Fisher:	Salon open mic!  Love it!
00:27:31	Siobhan O'Flynn:	Great tip re Wordhack! I may have to jump out - office hours - student here
00:28:05	Andrew Klobucar:	Caitlin + yes exactly…
00:28:10	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	people could show new art
00:28:44	Johannah Rodgers:	I love that idea!
00:28:59	Deena Larsen:	EBR
00:29:04	Deena Larsen:	Electronic Book REview
00:29:17	Deena Larsen:	REading texts together
00:29:25	Jules Chatelain:	"Read a text with other people together" (in small groups)
00:29:27	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	i like this reading group idea too
00:29:41	Deena Larsen:	It would help to be able to ask questions
00:29:47	Deena Larsen:	Reading groups--
00:29:47	Andrew Klobucar:	The reading group idea sounds great…
00:30:08	Deena Larsen:	While doing, I am learning
00:30:13	Christine Wilks:	I like that idea
00:30:17	Jules Chatelain:	Book launches can be done "anywhere" vs "while doing I am learning with others" (quoting Annie)
00:30:23	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	it takes advantage of the social, community aspect of the salon
00:30:44	Christine Wilks:	I like the sound of writing together too (I missed that salon)
00:31:58	Caitlin Fisher:	i think a book launch is a different beast - the driving force is to encourage a big audience. We can easily use breakout groups
00:32:38	Deena Larsen:	Two different groups:Announce megapohone with audienceSmaller groups with interaction
00:34:03	Deena Larsen:	Theater of war --
00:35:59	Deena Larsen:	Make a good guideline to start a series of events
00:36:00	Jules Chatelain:	BEST PRACTICES AND PROCESS
00:36:12	Deena Larsen:	PUt out a list of good ideas--and then get volunteers
00:36:26	Deena Larsen:	Having the fixed time and date and URL helps!
00:36:35	Jules Chatelain:	Fixed time / date / location … anyone can do this
00:37:14	Jules Chatelain:	Monthly seriesWORK LAUNCH"reading together"
00:37:47	Deena Larsen:	BAck up plan
00:39:09	Hannah Ackermans:	I would love to join you, Annie!
00:39:20	Deena Larsen:	ELO institutional support? Get the ELO channels? ELO zoom?
00:39:27	Caitlin Fisher:	sop maybe we need an umbrella structure sponsored by ELO?
00:39:27	Jules Chatelain:	A core of 3-4 people who show up every time, helps greatly with culture
00:39:32	Deena Larsen:	I want to be in the reading group too.
00:39:35	Johannah Rodgers:	I would also love to join the rewriting group.
00:39:55	Jules Chatelain:	reading/writing group!
00:40:03	Deena Larsen:	Maybe writepods could be a part of that too--a very closed group of 6 writers working on their pieces
00:40:45	Deena Larsen:	Many people can do this--one person for the reading, etc.
00:41:03	Andrew Klobucar:	Kind of how networks work. I’d love to participate in more reading groups like that…
00:41:14	Deena Larsen:	Sponsor four umbrella groups (reading, writing, discuss whatever, ELO salon as pilot)
00:41:27	Jules Chatelain:	(We have a report-back on the WRITEPODS tomorrow - I'm also posting the process documents on GitHub)
00:42:09	Andrew Klobucar:	Or workshops…
00:42:15	Deena Larsen:	YEs, ask for sponsors for groups, on York zoom.
00:42:31	Deena Larsen:	vote on official sponsorship for four initial groups.
00:42:51	Deena Larsen:	Sponsor: Provide zoom URL, announcements,
00:43:13	Deena Larsen:	website announcements. Archive IF WANTED??
00:43:35	Jules Chatelain:	(Extremely grateful to Annie and Deena for brainstorming this in Ireland)
00:44:08	Deena Larsen:	The ELO sponsorship, name would help.
00:44:19	Deena Larsen:	We would have to agree to the ELO Code of conduct...
00:45:30	Caitlin Fisher:	ELO as an organization benefits, too - These kind of events become a significant benefit to membership…
00:45:35	Deena Larsen:	Coordinate with Todd at wordhack for new work announcements? Could ELO send a message to membership about wordhack and allow everyone to contact directly
00:45:54	Hannah Ackermans:	ELO Virtual SalonsELO Virtual Reading GroupsELO Virtual WorkshopsELO Virtual Announcements
00:46:10	annie:	Reariting Groups
00:46:33	Hannah Ackermans:	https://elmcip.net/event/elo-virtual-salons
00:46:51	Johannah Rodgers:	Hannah has been archiving all of the previous salons in ELMCIP!
00:47:29	Deena Larsen:	ELO inclusion tinyurl.com/ELOinclusion
00:47:35	Deena Larsen:	Breakout rooms
00:47:41	Deena Larsen:	are workshop spaces...
00:47:48	Hannah Ackermans:	We can write a reflective summary in ELMCIP for reading groups without the recording if we don't want to make those public.
00:48:13	Deena Larsen:	hangout non recorded space
00:48:31	Johannah Rodgers:	@Hannah we could also just post the agenda and links to materials and resources engaged with
00:48:42	Hannah Ackermans:	Sure!
00:49:07	Deena Larsen:	REading groups--no video, can publish the re0writing text at the end
00:49:23	Caitlin Fisher:	Recording optional entirely possible!
00:49:33	Andrew Klobucar:	We should ask Alexa first if non-recording is allowed…
00:49:34	Jules Chatelain:	YES should be up to the participants
00:49:42	Jules Chatelain:	Andrew (LAUGH)
00:49:54	Caitlin Fisher:	the york zoom does warn people - much like the conference zoom here - that a session is being recorded
00:50:19	Johannah Rodgers:	@AndrewD Have you done much writing with Alexa?
00:50:40	Johannah Rodgers:	I find their comments to be slightly “canned.”
00:51:09	Deena Larsen:	@Johannnah--yes, and you must get with Lai-Tze on the bias in the canning!
00:51:19	Johannah Rodgers:	botulism!
00:51:31	Johannah Rodgers:	@Deena Agreed!
00:52:35	Caitlin Fisher:	I already want to know more about the groups too cool to be recorded. Definitely going to those ;)
00:53:09	Andrew Klobucar:	Caitlin - if ya gotta ask…
00:54:06	Deena Larsen:	Sponsorship for:Salon, book readings, Launches, First Friday...
00:54:12	Deena Larsen:	Core mandate for these
00:54:18	Deena Larsen:	Keep the Salon as the successful pilot
00:54:26	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Re Alexa, no, but it is super interesting and have wanted to
00:54:33	Deena Larsen:	One series to approve at one time:Get ELO channels, etc.
00:54:41	annie:	Please call it  Reariting
00:54:55	Jules Chatelain:	YES Annie the correct spelling!!
00:54:58	Deena Larsen:	Reariting
00:55:16	Hannah Ackermans:	Reariting, can you explain the name, I was not at the original one, sorry
00:55:28	Hannah Ackermans:	Is reariting the Rewriting or reading?
00:55:56	annie:	reading and writing together as a form of thinking together
00:56:08	Deena Larsen:	Open Mike--
00:56:25	Deena Larsen:	Announcement at the beginning.... in the existing salon as a pilot?
00:56:25	Hannah Ackermans:	Thank you!
00:57:03	annie:	A text to start with - read this all at the same time  and during that writing your reactions questions on a collaborative writing pad
00:57:23	Hannah Ackermans:	I loved being able to present my draft on accessibility in the Salon last year.
00:57:40	annie:	respond to other while reading and writing - a diffractive activity
00:57:45	Deena Larsen:	Ask for a sign up when we do the announcement... We will have 10 minutes at the beginning to announce--Then 50 minutes to talk, and then we hang out after...
00:57:53	Jules Chatelain:	Deena I am happy to help you put together a document describing these options in an open way, that people could review / give feedback, for presentation to ELO Board eventually
00:58:51	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	the open mic at wordhack never got too crowded, never more than 3 people sometimes not even that
00:59:11	Andrew Klobucar:	If it’s early enough in planning, I could certainly set aside time to moderate…
00:59:22	Jules Chatelain:	I can moderate things BEFORE 5am Pacific time - so those are good for Europe
00:59:33	Andrew Klobucar:	Or work with someone…
00:59:51	Jules Chatelain:	Andrew if you would make jokes, I'd work with you
00:59:57	Deena Larsen:	Open mike/workshop Andrew Reariting Annie Salon DeenaHang out (Mark?)

01:02:08	Andrew Klobucar:	It’s hard to keep up with everything, Deena!
01:02:42	Caitlin Fisher:	welcome all new people - it’s very meta here atm - thinking about reading groups as well as writing groups
01:03:53	Jules Chatelain:	That is what we did for the WRITEPOD - turned off pictures when working with WY so sound was robust
