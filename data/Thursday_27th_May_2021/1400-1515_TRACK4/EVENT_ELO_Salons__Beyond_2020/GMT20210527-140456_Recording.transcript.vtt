Deena Larsen: And we are now.

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:15.690
Deena Larsen: Recording so I we are I have of course screwed up the links and i'm think the easiest thing to do is just.

3
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
Deena Larsen: All of the emails are in the.

4
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:40.020
Deena Larsen: Our background drive which i'm trying to get to I tell you what before we start, we are being recorded can those people who have been the salons tell about their actions and their reactions, whilst I try to get this email, because I cannot do both at the same time yay.

5
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.830
Deena Larsen: Go for it 1000 patients and entertain folks well we try to figure this out i'm so sorry.

6
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.880
Caitlin Fisher: And Actually, I think, before we begin conference admins have a small video that they want to share at the beginning of each.

7
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.840
Deena Larsen: iteration So what do we.

8
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.890
Deena Larsen: share that.

9
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.230
Deena Larsen: And you shared your.

10
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.090
Deena Larsen: Link right.

11
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.320
Hannah Ackermans: The last link that I share, it is the correct wrong with that we're in now.

12
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.080
Deena Larsen: Okay, so i'm going to just for that to everyone.

13
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.970
Deena Larsen: So go ahead.

14
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.990
Deena Larsen: Go ahead.

15
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.480
Caitlin Fisher: men to share the Jingle.

16
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.190
Deena Larsen: Yes, share the jungle.

17
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.670
Deena Larsen: And I don't see your link.

18
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.390
Caitlin Fisher: And I like the Jingle that is purely conceptual.

19
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.760
Deena Larsen: I don't hear the Jingle either.

20
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.160
Caitlin Fisher: Well, why don't we just start just just.

21
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.210
Track Four: Conference Admin: we're having technical difficulties with showing the Jingle right now, but you can just.

22
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.650
Andrew Klobucar: People.

23
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.670
Andrew Klobucar: Can Can someone just hammered or.

24
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.300
Caitlin Fisher: Where we all have it in our heads now.

25
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.250
Caitlin Fisher: there's no point there's nothing better than.

26
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.540
Deena Larsen: filling the blanks face.

27
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.530
Caitlin Fisher: With our own jingles.

28
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.130
Deena Larsen: Hannah can you put the link in the chat please and i'll just copy it over.

29
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.350
Hannah Ackermans: yeah I just did.

30
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.700
Deena Larsen: I do.

31
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.290
Hannah Ackermans: Oh.

32
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.900
Deena Larsen: Please copy it again.

33
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.070
Stephanie Strickland: I see.

34
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.050
Deena Larsen: What are all these technical this is.

35
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.530
Deena Larsen: What happened.

36
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.970
Hannah Ackermans: I also just even.

37
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.380
Deena Larsen: Difficulties yeah.

38
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.740
Jules Chatelain: i've emailed it.

39
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.240
Jules Chatelain: and several of us have emailed it to you.

40
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.510
Deena Larsen: So for all of us have emailed it to us, this is the right.

41
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.680
Jules Chatelain: lingo to you.

42
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:51.600
Caitlin Fisher: But while we're starting here welcome everybody, and one of the cool things about the second Tuesday, is that we have the same link every time so should you wish to join us, it is same time same place same link.

43
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.030
Deena Larsen: yeah.

44
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:09.510
Caitlin Fisher: And it's been his brainchild and it's been actually a really wonderful combination of chances of people to share their work that we otherwise wouldn't have a chance to see and also opportunities to write together.

45
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:18.720
Caitlin Fisher: But I think the most important thing that i'd say is having having been a participant, is that it is incredibly generative and organic and responsive to the needs of the people who show up.

46
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.450
Caitlin Fisher: So it's pretty fluid it's not one thing i've been really, really grateful for it, as for a space to sort of pause and think.

47
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:37.050
Caitlin Fisher: To to interact with with new work with the with the author present but i've also really enjoyed the opportunity to write and for those.

48
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:51.270
Caitlin Fisher: Those sessions were and and just thinking about different methods and different ways of constraining creativity and making something happen in a short time so i've been super grateful to dina for for taking leadership on that and.

49
00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:02.430
Caitlin Fisher: Alan look there seems to be a screen ready to share so i'll turn it over to Dana and that's my small testimonial as a participant, and that is very welcoming cool place so.

50
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:12.150
Deena Larsen: Thank you, yes, then, thank you for the testimonial caitlin and we will have more testimonials at the end, but we are getting started, I do believe we are being recorded.

51
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:28.170
Deena Larsen: Yes, trek FM admin Okay, so no problem and honestly, most of the salons are recorded we bought we've done, one that has not been so somewhere out there in the ether and caitlin will and the rest of us will share the URLs for the recordings.

52
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.170
Deena Larsen: that'd be great, but here we go um I have a 10 minute.

53
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:52.650
Deena Larsen: presentation and then I was going to set it open as being open salon for everyone and the topic for today is, of course, how do we continue this and what's been valuable, so the electronic literature second Tuesday salons are the every second Tuesday online at 11am.

54
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:05.790
Deena Larsen: I guess it would be 11:11am Eastern time it's 9am my mountain time in the US so it's 3pm in the in the UK it's not too terrible.

55
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:17.250
Deena Larsen: Anyway, we are any and I any difference we were getting together in person at yellow 2019 and we honestly have been thinking about this for a long, long time before that.

56
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.360
Deena Larsen: Finally, we were like yeah we've really got to make this happen, we could do it monthly, it would be a shorter time commitment.

57
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:43.560
Deena Larsen: We can just open this up, and this is i'm not an academia, but you might get academic credit for what you're doing you know up to you and your university, but it becomes a platform for are works in progress, our ideas, our discussions and the idea was to keep it simple.

58
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:54.390
Deena Larsen: Everybody signed up to host a month, so I was in charge of like keeping the mailing list and seeing who signs up, and you know, doing the administer via.

59
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:03.300
Deena Larsen: caitlin and others and your Hannah did a wonderful job we're in charge of like recording and access and.

60
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:12.210
Deena Larsen: caitlin has done a fantastic job of letting up giving us her university zoom things have worked out, so we had the planning meeting in January of 2020.

61
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:23.160
Deena Larsen: Oh yeah That was the other thing i've gotten very ill after 2019, and this was like the first time I was out of that so we had our planning meeting, then we have our first real salon.

62
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.070
Deena Larsen: And then came the plague yeah.

63
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.980
Deena Larsen: It does, we were getting started it was like Okay, this is perfect timing, but.

64
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.950
Deena Larsen: Like other earlier plagues we studied tim's company of several of us have said, you know we're so tired of zoom but.

65
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.390
Deena Larsen: This zoom actually energizes us, we will look forward to this it's it's a family reunion it's been wonderful.

66
00:06:49.080 --> 00:07:01.980
Deena Larsen: And I did put the links in the chat if somebody was here and wants to be copied them, but you know how to Rogers did an incredible job of archiving our first salons you should go check this out it's amazing.

67
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:14.790
Deena Larsen: And Annie, thank you for hosting it so we read works together Carol took us through a section of an untitled poem by the contemporary Russian poet, and we had fun puzzling it out.

68
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:30.960
Deena Larsen: rehab has they took us through the dictionary of revolution by America happy oh my God that was the first time i'd seen this work, and it is one of my favorites now it is so beautiful you gotta check this one out man that's incredible um.

69
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.530
Deena Larsen: Any ever him well, you took us through of writing rewriting.

70
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.170
Deena Larsen: massively enlightening philosophical discussion, and then we got to write and frame a pad we got to see each other's words and we got to move each other's worth it was like a dance of words it's very fun.

71
00:07:50.130 --> 00:08:00.180
Deena Larsen: I followed this with you know, of course, this is my birthday, so we had a lunch together and showed how you could do excel writing and each column becomes one.

72
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:11.940
Deena Larsen: node one progression, and so you can have multi vocal discord and this discussion and multi multiple creative writing that was fun.

73
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:27.480
Deena Larsen: We went hunting for wild electronic literature games and we found quite a few with Lyle and she's got a list we searched the Wikipedia phenomenon and we wrote our own worlds in our own Wikipedia that was fun.

74
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:44.130
Deena Larsen: bill bly shut off his life's work in we descend Alan sondheim shut off his life's work in second life and elsewhere, those were really fascinating retrospectives and introspective and current subjective, so I guess because they're still being worked on.

75
00:08:46.230 --> 00:09:05.730
Deena Larsen: We cheered the yellows work the repository my God, this is amazing stuff and then we launched books, the digital humanities book we're going to launch another one this fall with that person bomb, we launched the African electronic literature database.

76
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.350
Deena Larsen: And then we brainstorm there's been a lot of discussion is community, as you can tell from the Code of Conduct there's been.

77
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:26.520
Deena Larsen: Some incidences and some really hard things that this Community has had to deal with, and so we offered up the electronic literature salon as a place to discuss this and we do have a lot of brainstorming.

78
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:39.420
Deena Larsen: In this link that yellow inclusion that we really need to follow up on, and we can do a lot of great things in this Community, so this salon has also become a launching place for ideas.

79
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:56.970
Deena Larsen: In May, I was sick, so we didn't do anything i'm sorry about that guys and we knew that this no no ma was this conference yeah because everybody was busy working on this conference, and a lot easier, but we have a full lineup we are set for this entire year.

80
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.220
Deena Larsen: In June we're going to do the playable communications with Lyle.

81
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:17.820
Deena Larsen: In July, we had so many questions about the yellow repository that we invited Dini, to come back and now we're going to get into the nuts and bolts of how this thing works and that'll be a great time for databases discussions coding that'll be fun.

82
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.920
Deena Larsen: Andrew is going to.

83
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:35.820
Deena Larsen: Introduce us to reverb which he's talked about in other places um we had this wonderful time and you can see it in the workshops we're going to glam it up with a hair salon and have a lot of fun with that with katie slag.

84
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:53.670
Deena Larsen: we're going to share stories on a new storytelling platform, but marcia them SIA has shown us we're gonna launch mats books and we're going to do generative text, one on one so join us.

85
00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:10.980
Deena Larsen: If you want originally our idea was it, it was going to be very small, and we, you know, keep it to a people, but what's really happened is it's brown somewhat organically people have signed up people have come and gone so it's kind of this open CAFE.

86
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:18.630
Deena Larsen: And we've done pretty well with keeping the numbers, to a degree, where we can all talk.

87
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:35.490
Deena Larsen: So we need volunteers, this is as per usual as for everything with the electronic literature, this is strictly a volunteer Labor of love, because we all love this field for some crazy reason i've never understood okay.

88
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:44.010
Deena Larsen: Do you guys want to spearhead another salon series this time is really awkward for people in Japan.

89
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:56.400
Deena Larsen: Elsewhere, maybe we China, maybe we want to spearhead another series that works with their timeframe, do you want to host a month 20 2020 2022 is completely open.

90
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.230
Deena Larsen: Nothing in there sign up now type thing Oh, we need an archivist, we need a place to record these my plates full my spoons are swamped.

91
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:19.800
Deena Larsen: If somebody could volunteer to record that would be amazing that would help a lot, and with that was going to open it up for participants and everyone.

92
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:25.800
Deena Larsen: Like caitlyn did a great job of showing us what she thought of it, and it really has been this wonderful space to.

93
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:42.900
Deena Larsen: Just connect every month it's something that I look forward to I have it on my calendar and I told my boss you touch my second Tuesdays and I leave now I can do that you're all welcome to my Freedom Party tonight, but yes, I threatened.

94
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.660
Deena Larsen: This is sacred time to me.

95
00:12:46.830 --> 00:13:09.300
Deena Larsen: But what did you get out of it, and everyone else, this is our planning session, what do we want to do, how do we want to do this, because this is for all of us, so that was my spiel and I will maybe stop sharing my screen, if I can figure out how tech is so much fun.

96
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.310
Deena Larsen: On but, whilst I figure this out.

97
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.210
Deena Larsen: feel free to.

98
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.880
Deena Larsen: chime in guys.

99
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.710
Deena Larsen: Most of you have been to a session and know what we're talking about.

100
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.910
annie: been share at the bottom somewhere.

101
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:43.950
Deena Larsen: and trying to get to the bottom, I, for some reason my screen has frozen and I can't i'm like trying to get to the bottom of my Green and I yeah if I you.

102
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.290
Deena Larsen: know that didn't do it.

103
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.080
Deena Larsen: To do it oh.

104
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.460
Caitlin Fisher: One thing i'll add that, when we were looking at the salons and that obviously for some.

105
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:12.450
Caitlin Fisher: kinds of meetings smaller is better I place in the chat that generally it's only been about a dozen people, except for the larger launches, but I also think that this is a really successful model also have.

106
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:20.670
Caitlin Fisher: Not just additional yellow salons because of a huge time difference, but there could be additional North American or European salons.

107
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.890
Caitlin Fisher: There could be you know smaller regional salons that could be under this umbrella.

108
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:37.050
Caitlin Fisher: That you know that we could that we could organize or you know even committed groups of people who write together could maybe join under the umbrella of the yellow salons I like the idea that.

109
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:46.260
Caitlin Fisher: kind of the title makes an intelligible for people and that it could be affiliated and capital five more so it's another way of thinking about it.

110
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.180
Deena Larsen: yeah.

111
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.430
Johannah Rodgers: that's a great point caitlin i'm and I see this as maybe I mean you know.

112
00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:06.960
Johannah Rodgers: it's been such a wonderful way to get to spend time with to get to meet people perhaps I wouldn't even have met at the conferences um.

113
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:19.290
Johannah Rodgers: But I found that over the time that my interests, for instance, tend towards specific types of salons so I mean I could imagine having.

114
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:30.960
Johannah Rodgers: You know either a schedule, where we had you know, the second you know every third month was dedicated to writing collaborative writing every fourth month to.

115
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:45.330
Johannah Rodgers: some kind of platform, you know tech more technical introduction to i'm thinking specifically of Daniel has workshop earlier this week on observable.

116
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:57.270
Johannah Rodgers: which you know um but, again, you know how do we, how do we keep it coherent enough that we don't splinter off into too many geographic distinctions or specialties.

117
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.060
Deena Larsen: Or if we had like even quarterly salons that did that.

118
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.350
Deena Larsen: So that if we had like a salon dedicated to writing platforms or a salon dedicated to writing.

119
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:18.390
Deena Larsen: or book launches we could do something like that there's so much stuff going on in yellow and so many Members.

120
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:25.680
Johannah Rodgers: i'd be curious to hear a bit more about from people who are particularly interested in the book launches and what they got out of.

121
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:39.030
Deena Larsen: Honestly, for me it was really difficult because somehow I was expected to be the moderator and i'd never seen the book before.

122
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.090
Deena Larsen: And so I didn't know what to ask.

123
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.320
Stephanie Strickland: I didn't have anything to do with the.

124
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:53.850
Stephanie Strickland: Book launches but I didn't know that at the town meeting many people devoted the chat to announcing their new projects.

125
00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:01.860
Stephanie Strickland: And it seems to me that I have a session, where the people are responsible for introducing their own book, I mean no one's kit.

126
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:11.250
Stephanie Strickland: As a moderator you're not supposed to have already known about all these things, these things are supposed to be new things, and if there's a place that people can introduce their work.

127
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:31.650
Stephanie Strickland: To you know to interested people, it seems to me that you could have maybe one one day, a quarter or some kind of thing like that, where new for new work to be introduced and people who wanted can sign up certainly there seemed to be eager as within the town hall for that.

128
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.840
Stephanie Strickland: To take advantage of that to present it to other people who would care.

129
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:47.520
Caitlin Fisher: I love that idea, but I also think that you can have the salons have too many things, maybe, so you know, maybe it could be like you know elo salon.

130
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.150
Caitlin Fisher: announced, or you know because I do think people are hungry to share their work, I think there's so many incredible people with.

131
00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:02.070
Caitlin Fisher: You know incredible core pieces of work to share like Ellen sometimes talk was just amazing, and I think it's so important for our community that it.

132
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:10.140
Caitlin Fisher: Be, and I mean all the talks were amazing i'm just picking out his but that'd be archived and I think, personally, I really like to encounter.

133
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:24.330
Caitlin Fisher: I think there are a lot of really fine writers, who show up and so finding out about more more about how they write in their practice and having a chance to write is something that i've been very interested in so i'd be worried about it being totally diluted where that happened like.

134
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.170
once a year it's.

135
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:32.310
Andrew Klobucar: Can can I offer a possible model for that there's there's a an event in.

136
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:42.090
Andrew Klobucar: Every third Thursday, I think, a very small gallery space and in New York City has the word hack.

137
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:50.310
Andrew Klobucar: event which is really informal and it's great although it's been visited a virtual, of course, for the past two years.

138
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.750
Andrew Klobucar: But even at a virtual the.

139
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.720
Andrew Klobucar: moderator Todd Anderson.

140
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:10.530
Andrew Klobucar: sets aside 15 minutes at the very beginning and everyone, you know, wants to sign up has three minutes to show their new project or offer a question.

141
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:19.590
Andrew Klobucar: And he's really good with maintaining the time and the 15 minutes would go and then it would go into the word hack the scheduled event.

142
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:30.030
Andrew Klobucar: And that was always fun because it said everybody has some sometimes they would just two people and they would get three minutes still so it'd be a six minute intro.

143
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:48.450
Andrew Klobucar: But if there were five people, then it would be 15 minutes, and that would be a good sign up you'd have this little projector when when everybody when it was all flesh and and human and and then you you just you just talk for three minutes and you sat down again it was good.

144
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.290
Deena Larsen: yeah that'd be cool like if we if we set aside 15 minutes at the, especially the beginning for like.

145
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.880
Jules Chatelain: Announcements like that for.

146
00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.750
Deena Larsen: new projects collaborative spaces that'd be great.

147
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.030
Deena Larsen: Oh chills.

148
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:16.530
Jules Chatelain: A trick a trick that i've used one trick but it's something i've done in other contexts, is for a book launch invite the person or project lunch invite the person to say who would you like to interview you.

149
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.240
Jules Chatelain: and other words, I agree that dina should not be responsible for reading everything ahead of time.

150
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:39.510
Jules Chatelain: And just say you know, please pick a person who would be a good interlocutor, or whatever and bring them with you, and in the best ones are friends who actually also bring up the hard questions with you, you know, and that makes it interesting for everybody.

151
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:47.400
Deena Larsen: And I think we can still keep it in the three minutes would be one question and answer any what oh you're on mute any.

152
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.040
annie: I know I wasn't talking yet, but.

153
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.940
annie: I have been thinking before and my interest is in.

154
00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.850
annie: Regular quite small gatherings where.

155
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:15.210
annie: Somehow reread read to get a reading group group that's also writing so in the follow up of my rewriting session.

156
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:22.320
annie: But that's it's all very personal because it's also, for instance in a re air Eva.

157
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:34.290
annie: The big thing where all lots of things are published, sometimes I read something and not really sure if I understand everything of it.

158
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:45.390
annie: i'm not really sure if I have the right context for it to understand it and i've been in other reading groups, if you read a text with other people together.

159
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:56.520
annie: And if you know these people get to know them a little bit you can ask childish questions you can admit you don't know that philosopher.

160
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:16.890
annie: And someone will explain it in two lines and you make a big jump in how you know things and how you can process things so that's something that I would like to have it's not it wouldn't be as simple I think and i'm not sure other people would like to do that.

161
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.330
annie: Also, but it would be something that I would like to do.

162
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:35.940
annie: i'm not so interested in interested in book launches or presentations but more in something where while doing on with us.

163
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.300
Johannah Rodgers: I completely agree, I think that's a wonderful idea and one thing I should mention is.

164
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:55.380
Johannah Rodgers: You know, one of the things that i've gotten one of the most valuable things i've gotten out of the salons was, for instance from annie's any any salon where we were writing together.

165
00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:09.390
Johannah Rodgers: I ended up getting in touch with the writer, whose work we were thinking about a little bit as part of that, and you know, so making connections, even outside of the yellow, which is so valuable.

166
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:24.660
Deena Larsen: yeah and that's one of the nice things about this is the Salon has invited people who are not connected with yellow and it's been a good outreach, but I think it could be so much more of an outreach as well, that would be cool.

167
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:39.870
Deena Larsen: And it sounds like we're looking at a lot of different groups and the thing is, I think, each group would love any as idea and we did want to keep the small is the point two, so if we had a lot of groups were five to 20 people came.

168
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:47.310
Deena Larsen: This that would be great the problem with the book launch was, quite frankly, there were too many people.

169
00:23:49.320 --> 00:24:04.830
Deena Larsen: We opened it up, and it was dead silence we're not going to talk because there's 50 people here, but like anything if we had five people I wouldn't I would feel fine to open up to say hey I don't know this or hey, what do you think about this.

170
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:11.520
Deena Larsen: and engage much more in a original idea which was small group.

171
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.020
Deena Larsen: So maybe do many small groups and just five or six people come in that's great.

172
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:29.580
Stephanie Strickland: I agree it is great interest in doing that kind of work and having something that actually is there a meaningful discussion, but I think.

173
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:41.400
Stephanie Strickland: We also do need, as we get much larger as an organization, a way to have a big megaphone about all the work that's out there and that that's a different kind of a problem.

174
00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:49.740
Stephanie Strickland: And it maybe needs a different kind of a solution, but people need to know there is a place that actually the only people there to listen.

175
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.660
Deena Larsen: You know it's annoying.

176
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.050
Stephanie Strickland: and say whether or not yellow does a.

177
00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:05.010
Stephanie Strickland: yearly half yearly or whatever it is, you know I think people have tried to suggest discord, but I think something more.

178
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.910
Stephanie Strickland: Not everybody is underscored as someplace that almost everybody would be or would learn to be.

179
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:27.900
Stephanie Strickland: That this is where you learn about new books and do 11 new whatever it is, and in you know, but again, in a word, heck not not at length have more chance for more people to present their work in a in a you know potted way.

180
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:38.730
Deena Larsen: Yes, exactly when I do want to note, if you guys don't have chat open may want to open it up, this is what always happens in in the salons is we.

181
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:46.770
Deena Larsen: usually have to multifocal things going, we have the chat and we have the people and it's very engaging kind of exhausting but yeah.

182
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:59.580
Deena Larsen: I agree stephanie it would be really cool to have like an audience focused announcement place so you don't want to announce your books or the elo repository or stuff with five people.

183
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.030
Deena Larsen: Right and but at the same time.

184
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.510
Deena Larsen: And he's point to where you don't want to.

185
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.020
Deena Larsen: Try to explore something with 30 people.

186
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:11.760
Stephanie Strickland: Right.

187
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:11.940
I.

188
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:13.320
Stephanie Strickland: Think.

189
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:31.080
Stephanie Strickland: The most the most engaging thing that ever heard this occurred to me during the pandemic was an eel it at all, it was something called theater of war and it used to be done in person around the world by a man who really translates the Greek classics.

190
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.850
Stephanie Strickland: and takes scenes from them.

191
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:46.290
Stephanie Strickland: Around contemporary issues, whether it's homelessness or I mean immigration and stuff and political owners many things you know ensure how it'll be.

192
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:57.030
Stephanie Strickland: Given he gets film stars to do these theater parts Frances mcdormand and you know so forth, so you see their faces close up.

193
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.290
Stephanie Strickland: On zoom maybe for people they're reading from their home.

194
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:07.830
Stephanie Strickland: But then they have an international audience and they have a PIC audience of people to respond.

195
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:17.460
Stephanie Strickland: They may be people who never went to a play before they may be a homeless person, it might be an immigrant from Venezuela and then you have they have literally an international audience.

196
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:27.270
Stephanie Strickland: And the skill, is the man who is able to interview these people and bring their you would not imagine what the responses to oedipus the colonists are.

197
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:36.270
Stephanie Strickland: From people in different situations, and it seems to me that this is what we're lacking, and this is what we don't get when we have just when we just talk to each other.

198
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:45.330
Deena Larsen: That makes sense and that outreach and I apologize I didn't have hannah's hand up I didn't have the participants thing up so Hannah yeah.

199
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.490
Hannah Ackermans: Yes, I just want to say, partly to reiterate that.

200
00:27:52.440 --> 00:28:00.360
Hannah Ackermans: I really love all of these different ideas with reading groups and work ethic, and everything, but also to protect us from ourselves.

201
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:09.540
Hannah Ackermans: Because we are very generative community, I would just like to say, not everything that would be a very good idea to do with the yellow needs to happen in this alliance.

202
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:15.480
Hannah Ackermans: And I think that all of these ideas are very good, and one of the things that we could do, for example.

203
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:32.070
Hannah Ackermans: is to make a good guideline of the things we've done to make these salons run well that can be a guideline for someone else who wants to also start a series of events so that it's easier for them to organize something, because they have something.

204
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:41.610
Hannah Ackermans: To start from and they don't have to reinvent the wheel, but without making us responsible for everything that needs to happen in the Community.

205
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.420
Caitlin Fisher: And I think one of the easiest things is actually having a fixed time.

206
00:28:52.440 --> 00:29:05.370
Caitlin Fisher: And a fixed date and a fixed location which doesn't rely on having to have like dina's special brilliant almost anyone can do that, like we're all so busy, and so spread thin and we're all.

207
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:19.650
Caitlin Fisher: You know, late to the events, because we're searching out URLs and stuff I think I think it'd be fantastic to have a monthly book launch slot where sometimes it happens, and sometimes it doesn't and not necessarily run by us but run by elo, for example.

208
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.040
Deena Larsen: It doesn't have to be a.

209
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.210
Stephanie Strickland: Book right, it can be.

210
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.740
Stephanie Strickland: Launching the whole work yeah.

211
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.180
Caitlin Fisher: yeah oh yeah for sure.

212
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.280
Hannah Ackermans: or anything like.

213
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.370
Hannah Ackermans: Reading group that's a monthly series as well.

214
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:33.930
Deena Larsen: yeah.

215
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:42.180
Deena Larsen: yeah and then, if you had a default and I think that's something we need to need to do with with the salons i'm perfectly happy to do it for the next year, whatever.

216
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:55.890
Deena Larsen: If the moderator or have a have a backup moderator or have a default hey if nobody comes up with the book that we're going to talk about we're going to go to this, you know it's always there.

217
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.600
Deena Larsen: Whoever shows up oh yeah it's default day.

218
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.910
Deena Larsen: That might help a lot, because it has been a bit of a stretch.

219
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.490
Deena Larsen: With my full time job and illness, to come up with the slots.

220
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:19.110
Deena Larsen: And so I think part of the lessons learned here is always to have a backup plan.

221
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:30.750
Deena Larsen: And jewels is the most brilliant person I know for doing best practices and process, and I think you've already gotten some of this stuff.

222
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.410
Deena Larsen: i'm not volland told you Jules I know you.

223
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:49.770
Deena Larsen: Know volunteer holding is really bad, but maybe we can come up with some best practices and stuff well any yeah.

224
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.580
annie: And I have a question so because.

225
00:30:54.990 --> 00:31:08.730
annie: For me it's important that it's easy and close to me, and I can I can go to a salon when I want I can go to the discord when I want if i'm happy enough to do it.

226
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:17.190
annie: But if I want to have my reading group I could start it, for instance in September but.

227
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:35.130
annie: If I don't have a place to tell people we are going to have, I am going to organize a reading group are we writing group, then I will be on my own, and I need at least three more people.

228
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:36.840
annie: To make.

229
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.930
annie: yeah so good, I.

230
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:58.200
annie: write an email to mark Marino and good I us to your zoom because we always should have to start with the zoo to explain what it would be about and then later on, go to the reading and writing.

231
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.100
annie: Is that a possibility, or should it be done differently.

232
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:21.450
Caitlin Fisher: I like that idea, a lot, I think, maybe hearing from that point and hannah's that that elo should maybe be presented, that they sponsor like maybe there's some kind of umbrella structure and the salons become part of that and there could be reading groups that are part of that and.

233
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:37.890
Caitlin Fisher: I mean in terms of the mechanics are happy to happy to continue to sponsor these small groups until it hits a scale where that's not sustainable, but I think you know easily we could have our reading group as part of that, and they think yellow.

234
00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:48.150
Caitlin Fisher: And you know I say someone on the executive like committed to amplifying these events, if the membership would like to have reading groups and would like to have the organization.

235
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:59.940
Caitlin Fisher: help to communicate that and help to connect people I think that's absolutely something we're committed to doing I think that'd be a really good use of our time so So yes, any yes.

236
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.120
Caitlin Fisher: And I think you know if there's someone has the energy to.

237
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:13.770
Caitlin Fisher: To to organize a reading group, then, absolutely the organization, will have the energy to at least send out messages and to try to help to connect you with other people interested in that book.

238
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.470
Stephanie Strickland: and giving caitlyn do you think the Board should.

239
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:34.140
Stephanie Strickland: make a specific statement of at a point that we will you know sponsor a say for umbrella group small groups, as you know, as a to try this out one would be a meeting want to be a reading group, one would be discuss what you want, or whatever Dean is group has been.

240
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:43.560
Caitlin Fisher: I think i'd look at it more that the yellow salon has been a successful pilot for well over a year and to present that to the board for like an official.

241
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.740
Caitlin Fisher: Official sponsorship, I mean it was mentioned at the town hall, this is something we do, we can.

242
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.190
Caitlin Fisher: We can.

243
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.390
Caitlin Fisher: enter into, and I think with the yellow salon as a model.

244
00:33:55.110 --> 00:34:00.300
Caitlin Fisher: That yeah we might not want to have 40,000 of them, but I but i'm what i'm hearing is there just might be three or four.

245
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:07.770
Caitlin Fisher: And I don't think we have to quantify how many, that is, but that every you know that that under the reason I was thinking of an umbrella group is that maybe.

246
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.740
Caitlin Fisher: Maybe, on the strength of the yellow salons.

247
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:22.770
Caitlin Fisher: This group here could sort of assist those smaller groups so that any, for example, with your reading group wouldn't have to go through a piloting thing or figuring out what it was, it could be sort of like you know, based on the yellow salon model it's a yellow salon.

248
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.550
Caitlin Fisher: study or ios alone and that would.

249
00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:44.610
Stephanie Strickland: But instead of writing mark and all that she could just send a query to the board saying on you know salon model, I would like to sponsor a reading, writing group, and you know to be called this to meet at this time on the York soon, which you are offering.

250
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.930
Caitlin Fisher: And exactly.

251
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.110
Stephanie Strickland: Exactly all say that's really nice and that's good.

252
00:34:49.560 --> 00:35:02.430
Caitlin Fisher: yeah and I think we have to vote on official sponsorship anyway, I was just trying to figure out ways of making it easier for Annie that maybe it could all come in at the same time, if we had specific ideas, so that the board could agree that this is something worth sponsoring and then.

253
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:04.140
Stephanie Strickland: What I.

254
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.020
annie: mean is really mean what does that mean.

255
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:21.000
Stephanie Strickland: It means we're going to sponsor a reading group that you would lead on the model of the Salon would you make whatever way you want it to be, but on model of the Salon and that it needs in a regular time on zoom.

256
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.530
annie: So I would be sure.

257
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.290
Caitlin Fisher: it'd be all your energy, but what elo offers a sponsorship is.

258
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.950
Caitlin Fisher: kind of exactly what you were noting at the beginning that mark would send stuff out.

259
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:45.510
Caitlin Fisher: That we would try to commit to putting stuff up on the website that we would try to amplify the initiative and your energy to make sure that people knew about it until you had to have critical mass, and that it would mean we saw it as a service to other Members.

260
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.250
Andrew Klobucar: I was part of.

261
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.290
Caitlin Fisher: Our thanks to you for for.

262
00:35:50.070 --> 00:36:04.830
Andrew Klobucar: Have a network like that in Vancouver and it it had gone on for 30 years, actually, and it was a kidney school of writing, and that it worked very much like that you, you presented your ideas to the can still view.

263
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:16.740
Andrew Klobucar: The case w would amplify it that at readings, they would say oh and don't forget there's this workshop that we're doing and but if there was no pressure for kids to be.

264
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:25.680
Andrew Klobucar: writers and readers to go to every workshop, it was just a great way and we always knew we were at a kidney school.

265
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.830
Andrew Klobucar: sponsored event that that gave it a kind of group and there again, you could use.

266
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:41.460
Andrew Klobucar: The the gallery space that we had for your for your reading groups on the weekends over the summer and really great writers would would often come.

267
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:54.240
Andrew Klobucar: You know, we wouldn't pay them much, but we would use Canada Council funding, you know, maybe $500 for the for the for the person who was directing it and, like writers like Lisa Robertson.

268
00:36:54.990 --> 00:37:11.730
Andrew Klobucar: would have a six week reading series and the summer, we would pay her through Canada Council $500 but you registered for it, you signed up for it and you had it there was no pressure, but it was it was a great very vibrant Community fantastic.

269
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:20.040
Andrew Klobucar: way to do things, I think that would be, and we did have a best practices, so we knew what we were doing is good.

270
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.160
Johannah Rodgers: just wanted to bounce an idea off of you guys regarding.

271
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:35.520
Johannah Rodgers: The presentation of new work if it might be a good idea to coordinate with Todd at word hack I mean.

272
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:42.630
Johannah Rodgers: Since, so I mean I don't know I don't know if that sounds what, what do you guys think of that.

273
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.040
Johannah Rodgers: I don't know.

274
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:58.920
Stephanie Strickland: I think mark that mark or yo could certainly send out a message to the membership that one of the places to preview your work, if you would like to his word hack and to do this, you should get in touch with Todd and.

275
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.200
Stephanie Strickland: Certainly no problem with it.

276
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.140
Johannah Rodgers: i'll be at that.

277
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:21.420
Deena Larsen: yeah that makes sense i'm caitlin I think this would be a pretty low investment would be the yellow announcements would be trying to get some space on the yellow website.

278
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:33.180
Deena Larsen: And it would be using the zoom which, thank you for having that permanent URL helps a lot um but i'm also wondering, can we go, the next step to archiving.

279
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.070
Deena Larsen: People.

280
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.740
Caitlin Fisher: Everything is being automatically archived right so.

281
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:38.160
Caitlin Fisher: Those are.

282
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.840
Deena Larsen: All the time in New York.

283
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:46.410
Caitlin Fisher: is constantly there and it's being archived almost immediately on the LM SIP database so archiving has not been an issue.

284
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.540
Deena Larsen: Oh good in that case tell me the URLs where it's archived because people are always asking me and I go.

285
00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.290
Caitlin Fisher: Hannah Hannah.

286
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.100
Caitlin Fisher: Hannah put the URL in the chat at the very beginning.

287
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.330
Caitlin Fisher: And, at one point I sent you an email, with all of the.

288
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.870
Good.

289
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.030
Deena Larsen: and

290
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:13.140
Stephanie Strickland: Bad does anybody think that having a free form reading, writing be not archived is more or less inhibited.

291
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.200
Deena Larsen: Oh yeah exactly so we would have the option of.

292
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.490
Deena Larsen: Recording and not recording.

293
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.320
Deena Larsen: And that would work as well.

294
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.260
Deena Larsen: it's just that everybody seems to ask me where the archives are and I just like.

295
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.660
Caitlin Fisher: The majority of been archived I also think.

296
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:39.060
Caitlin Fisher: To the way i've set up the zoom is it kind of records automatically I could easily mix whoever's co host and they can turn it on and off I think we've had some things that have seemed a bit more vulnerable where we haven't.

297
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:45.120
Caitlin Fisher: When we had the inclusion solution salon we decided, very specifically, not to archive that.

298
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:51.720
Caitlin Fisher: Because, so people could feel like they could talk freely and not have that, as part of public record, while we work through issues.

299
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:59.400
Caitlin Fisher: Any breakout room, I think I think breakout rooms are possible, even when the host isn't there, and none of the breakout rooms are ever recorded.

300
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:13.260
Caitlin Fisher: So you could have a dual salon where you're part of the welcome, and you know saying you know, this is what the Salon is about is part of the public record and then the breakout rooms are just workshop spaces, where people can be vulnerable and share graphs.

301
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:20.970
Stephanie Strickland: Especially what Andy was saying a small group of people working on things are part of this, you can ask what she called child.

302
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:32.190
Stephanie Strickland: time we all have you know all that is like you know you're not it's Nice, not to be surveilled in every moment in my.

303
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.380
Deena Larsen: Totally well.

304
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:45.480
Caitlin Fisher: it's easy enough to set up a whole different URL that would never be recorded and it could just be a hangout space that's not a that's not a technical issue at all that would just be a different space yeah.

305
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.410
Waliya Yohanna: Hello kitty please.

306
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.570
Waliya Yohanna: Hello katelyn would have done it.

307
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.790
Deena Larsen: Well, it just a moment jewels and then, and then you.

308
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.260
Deena Larsen: Oh you're popping so any.

309
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:19.830
annie: Okay, I just had a remark if shy can make the rewriting groups work, they will will no be video recording no video recording just the text at the end and that can be published as a PDF summary of.

310
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:32.460
Deena Larsen: What were you talking about like the transcript that goes well, how do you like transcript or just text, the text of the lighting okay.

311
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:37.830
annie: And the rewriting at the end, that will be there and that's it.

312
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.680
annie: Plus, maybe one screen capture.

313
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.980
Deena Larsen: That makes a lot of sense yeah um.

314
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.980
Stephanie Strickland: But also the things where you're reading something and asking a lot of questions or people ask you know.

315
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.300
Stephanie Strickland: I just think.

316
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.270
Stephanie Strickland: We have to the participants whether.

317
00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:10.410
Deena Larsen: yeah I agree stephanie i'd love to be in a reading group, where I can ask the stupid questions, and I think, to have that freedom to ask stupid questions because so many people have the reputation to keep up.

318
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.290
Stephanie Strickland: With some don't but.

319
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.360
Stephanie Strickland: These questions are much better than on childish questions in general.

320
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.380
Deena Larsen: yeah, but if we can ask those childish questions without being surveilled.

321
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:25.590
Deena Larsen: As.

322
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:30.780
Stephanie Strickland: Money was exactly well i'd like to be not always.

323
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:41.700
Caitlin Fisher: So i'll just say just for the record the easiest thing to because it's very, very difficult to set things up to if you know automatically that you are hosting.

324
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:50.760
Caitlin Fisher: A writing space, you have no interested in recording it the record of the writing space will just be that there was a series of events, you know that will be titles of them are date.

325
00:42:51.360 --> 00:43:05.940
Caitlin Fisher: Then it can easily be set up with no recording possible, if you think you might want recording the better thing to do is to set to record automatically and to have a Co host disable it because, otherwise, if if it's set up and it's not set up to record and there's no kind of.

326
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:06.930
Caitlin Fisher: host in the room.

327
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:17.070
Caitlin Fisher: You won't be able to start a recording at the last minute, but this is not a deal breaker I think it's actually really great to sort of imagine that I would imagine, most of the book launches we want to have a recording.

328
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:27.030
Caitlin Fisher: For people talking about their like I think Alice on time, you know just going back to that, I mean I think he was planning on having that recorded and that that was part of almost a performer to thing of what he was doing.

329
00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:41.880
Caitlin Fisher: And for people who don't want that, of course, we don't want to have spaces that are all surveyed spaces and we can never talk anymore without imagining that our camera persona I think I think we don't have to, I think we can absolutely strike a balance.

330
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:50.580
Deena Larsen: I think we can strike a balance, and I think it's so great to have the York platform and as part of this, and I think.

331
00:43:51.090 --> 00:44:02.850
Deena Larsen: This will benefit you benefit elo as well, because we can have that outreach so if we have these groups, then we can say to everyone here we're doing this, for example on the salons where it's appropriate.

332
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:12.690
Deena Larsen: i've been announcing them on Facebook on the higher education group and we've had folks come in, who are not in yellow and we've managed to snare a few.

333
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:22.740
Deena Larsen: But it would be good, I think what I think we could do, though, is maybe present these as umbrella organizations like you're saying caitlyn and then say okay.

334
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.070
Deena Larsen: We would have a reading group, and it would be this this you know if we had four of them, it would be one per week.

335
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:38.970
Deena Larsen: And we would have the reading group, then we could have the discussion group, then we could have whatever and people could go to those I know we have like the first Friday on discord.

336
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:55.590
Deena Larsen: It might be good to just have that as a zoom as the URL as well i'm on the on the hangout space, the non recorded one, so you always knew what URL to go to you always knew what day of the week to go to and what time.

337
00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.600
Deena Larsen: stagger them.

338
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:06.210
Deena Larsen: It wouldn't be so Eurocentric and we wouldn't have to ask for people like some young white malia to join us at two o'clock in the morning.

339
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.120
Deena Larsen: That might help.

340
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:14.820
Waliya Yohanna: Hello.

341
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:17.550
Deena Larsen: yeah.

342
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:25.200
Deena Larsen: i'm well, maybe we could just go ahead and say here's the reading group and then get volunteers to do to do those readings.

343
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:31.020
Deena Larsen: Because it is a commitment, and maybe people would just want to do a quarterly one.

344
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:37.590
Deena Larsen: And we could have a Google Doc where people could sign up or.

345
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.190
Deena Larsen: have some more streamlined administration.

346
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:43.290
Deena Larsen: That might help.

347
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.700
Caitlin Fisher: I think these are all great ideas, and I think it's Actually, I think we should you know.

348
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.650
Caitlin Fisher: The salon works, the way the Salon works, and I think being able to say that it has been a successful pilot.

349
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:04.320
Caitlin Fisher: I think i'd be happy to take any texts that this group or to generate or even part of the transcript is from here.

350
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:14.430
Caitlin Fisher: To the board and stephanie stephanie and I could both just presented, as you know, would like official sponsorship and it sounds like we are you know official sponsorship for like a salon.

351
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:27.780
Caitlin Fisher: and associated reading series and associated book launch series and or the yellow takes over like there could be a vibrant discussion where the yellow says the book launch series should be done on X server and you know.

352
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:42.390
Caitlin Fisher: which I think it sounds like from this soup it's fine I don't feel the Salon has to have ownership over all activities if somebody else wants to organize and then we can figure out what the core mandate is of the salons but really piggyback on the incredible success that.

353
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:52.560
Caitlin Fisher: Of of your initiative here dina to help other people and to also streamline it for elo so maybe we just have one series of things that can all be approved at the same.

354
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:52.920
Caitlin Fisher: Time.

355
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.660
Caitlin Fisher: And then we'll also receive.

356
00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:01.350
Caitlin Fisher: You know, access to elo channels and to mark's amazing stuff as well and.

357
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.620
Caitlin Fisher: If I miss hearing them that's fine.

358
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.470
Caitlin Fisher: But i'm happy to bring that forward along with stephanie here.

359
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.710
Stephanie Strickland: I agree can't I just think that the one case of.

360
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:19.710
Stephanie Strickland: Any who are wanting to do the writing group or reading together group is already so specific that to say she would she.

361
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:28.170
Stephanie Strickland: would like to do that, on the model of the Salon like we said, do you know and then at that time, we can say other things that were also proposed.

362
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:45.660
Stephanie Strickland: which perhaps we should discuss further should book launches go by this model or something different, because there wasn't an agreement that this model worked best for small groups, whereas book launches a kind of a megaphone thing which might work large groups, and so I don't think.

363
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:46.890
Deena Larsen: You should come into them.

364
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:51.060
Caitlin Fisher: yeah something like, no, no, I was just trying to avoid extra Labor and like.

365
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:51.420
Caitlin Fisher: A.

366
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.490
Caitlin Fisher: bunch of potential models in at the same.

367
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:54.060
Caitlin Fisher: Time but.

368
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:54.480
Stephanie Strickland: yeah.

369
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.310
Caitlin Fisher: I totally agree yeah.

370
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:05.790
Deena Larsen: yeah I think if we did do a proposal and it would just have the for the rewriting um where you're reading and writing about a book with on Annie.

371
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:17.070
Deena Larsen: The salons are really kind of merging into a mishmash and I don't like that very much, I mean we're committed for this year, but for next year, maybe tailor it a bit.

372
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.440
Deena Larsen: And then have.

373
00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.440
Deena Larsen: Again, like the first Friday where it's just hey come out and.

374
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.700
Deena Larsen: hang out and then a new launch with those be the for.

375
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.710
Caitlin Fisher: You also.

376
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:36.600
Caitlin Fisher: Back to Andrews statement, I also think yellow salon open MIC as a separate kind of event where somebody.

377
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:50.250
Caitlin Fisher: yeah either I think independent with you felt it would eat too much into this if it turns out that it's just a couple of people every time with a three minute thing at the beginning, then that's I think sustainable in the context of the existing salon and in live in it.

378
00:48:51.630 --> 00:49:07.650
Caitlin Fisher: were a lot of people who had a lot of stuff to share and that that became you know if that's a need in the Community, to have a place, we could maybe consider piloting, where we could have an open MIC thing i've often talked to people who.

379
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:14.340
Caitlin Fisher: Who don't feel like at the point where they're submitting their work or wanting to feel like they are.

380
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:21.780
Caitlin Fisher: You know they might not feel like they want to be showcased or they're not at that point in their career, but could would totally love to maybe read some of their work.

381
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:31.890
Caitlin Fisher: You know, if you think about the elo conferences and who kind of gets those performance spots very well established people we don't have a lot of vehicles for people starting out to.

382
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:44.460
Caitlin Fisher: Read or perform or share and so i've seen that, as a hunger and I wouldn't want that necessarily to become the salons or to take the place of what's happening in the salons, but I could see that as another track potential.

383
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:52.710
Andrew Klobucar: And I think in electronic literature, especially which you wouldn't find in non digital writing so much as people saying listen.

384
00:49:53.250 --> 00:50:02.610
Andrew Klobucar: i've reached a point where i'm not a limited my programming skills and I really need somebody to help me with with the javascript for this effect.

385
00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:10.320
Andrew Klobucar: And that's what I liked about Anderson too often they were they were it was it was comfortable enough where people will say listen, I really want to get this.

386
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:24.000
Andrew Klobucar: To move i'm in the style of this work, I just don't know how to do it can is there anybody out there and because it'd be like 30 people the audience would be like four people would say yeah let's let's I can do that let's do that, and that was really, really good.

387
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:38.520
Caitlin Fisher: So maybe, what we need to do is find somebody who would spearhead all of these because I can imagine that dina has the energy sector at all of them into moderate so easily at all of them, but I mean, I think.

388
00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:50.880
Caitlin Fisher: I think that's something where yeah I love the idea of like open MIC and workshop day could maybe be once a month there's an open day for that and we could see if that goes and and and each group and the existing salons.

389
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.560
Caitlin Fisher: And I guess the question would just be could be could we.

390
00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.460
Caitlin Fisher: could find somebody who would agree to.

391
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:06.660
Caitlin Fisher: sort of moderate any given event for, say, a one year pilot period like once a month, so it's 12 days.

392
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.360
Caitlin Fisher: Then those could be a go.

393
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.530
Deena Larsen: If we did it.

394
00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:21.720
Johannah Rodgers: Logistically I mean i'm it could be, is the elo have any administrative support that and it could provide to dina.

395
00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:40.980
Caitlin Fisher: Or it has administrative support, but I don't know whether it could what it could provide it's very limited out of the University of Washington, but if there was a very specific ask about what would be helpful than we could bring that to the board I don't know.

396
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:48.990
Caitlin Fisher: Like we're really operating where we've got somebody very able holly holly slocum was amazing, but I think she's only been paid for 10 hours a week.

397
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:51.780
Deena Larsen: and honestly I think the.

398
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.250
Stephanie Strickland: Work of the organization.

399
00:51:53.310 --> 00:52:08.100
Deena Larsen: yeah the administration hasn't been that bad it's pretty much been a Google Doc and I think if we just keep it as open and as simple as possible will be good, but what i'm thinking is if we had a volunteer for the monthly open MIC workshop.

400
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:14.400
Deena Larsen: And even if we just did it for six months, so it will be a six month commitment.

401
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:15.270
Deena Larsen: And I.

402
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.340
Caitlin Fisher: volunteered and always.

403
00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.160
Andrew Klobucar: do that if it's.

404
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:30.540
Andrew Klobucar: going to I could I could set aside time now for it, what I could just say to my department listen i'm doing this don't do anything on this day and that would be fine.

405
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.900
Deena Larsen: Okay, and do you want to start it like January 2022 any same deal, or do you want to start it now.

406
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:53.880
Deena Larsen: You want to do any do you want to do, like, for the rest of 2021 like informal and we can keep announcing it kind of like you do your dance movements and then we could like start in January of 2022.

407
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.150
annie: But that but I need six people to start with.

408
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.240
Deena Larsen: And I don't want it to six people.

409
00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:05.100
Deena Larsen: We can get you six people that's the same as what choose an idea for the right pod.

410
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.060
Deena Larsen: You could probably get six people to sign up no.

411
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:10.380
Stephanie Strickland: No, she has.

412
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:16.020
Stephanie Strickland: in mind some people that she knows will be will work well with what she has in mind, I mean.

413
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.360
annie: I can, I think I have.

414
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:23.730
annie: To to better explain the concept and together with.

415
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:27.510
annie: Maybe to recording of what we did in the saddle.

416
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:49.830
annie: yeah i'm glad that maybe that could work together i'm not sure, but I will try to find out in the next few months, and then I can write it down short me I hope so, and maybe that could be just announced to all the people, and then I will get to people, I will won't get the both of them.

417
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.660
annie: i'm sure.

418
00:53:52.830 --> 00:54:00.600
annie: who are interested, I can say this first a few test sessions, and then we will make it.

419
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.960
annie: Real after that.

420
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.190
Deena Larsen: yeah and any I just I did not know I.

421
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:15.150
Deena Larsen: So sorry guys, I did not know about this incredible resource on film set because i'm an idiot.

422
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:18.540
Deena Larsen: Thank you for.

423
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:30.900
Jules Chatelain: All of this, this is amazing dina helpful do not call yourself an idiot do not call me okay let's just be in the moment okay let's let go of these judgments positive or negative.

424
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.110
Okay process.

425
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.060
Caitlin Fisher: I love it.

426
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.160
Caitlin Fisher: I love coming now because of the time zone.

427
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:55.020
Jules Chatelain: I love annie's idea of a trial one just just do one for a short period of and and any did explain it in the chat you talked about everyone reads the same text, and then they have a shared writing space, but a longer explanation to that would would.

428
00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.290
Jules Chatelain: be good, so people know they want to do it yeah.

429
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.380
annie: I think I even have written something about that.

430
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.360
Deena Larsen: I think so it's.

431
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.700
Not so difficult to to make something.

432
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:09.720
Deena Larsen: short announcement and you limit it to six.

433
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.880
Deena Larsen: People, which is what we did with the right parts.

434
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:14.130
Deena Larsen: Please can I know this is something.

435
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.300
You.

436
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:17.640
Deena Larsen: guys.

437
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:21.240
Deena Larsen: are either.

438
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:30.450
Deena Larsen: This has been an issue with connection as well we'll leave it might be easier for you to type and let us know when you're on.

439
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:38.970
Deena Larsen: Again yeah we are speaking from a point of privilege, where we have a good Internet connection.

440
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.520
annie: Or maybe not use image and only sound.

441
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.090
Deena Larsen: yeah whoo.

442
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.620
Deena Larsen: lily can you talk in the chat if you're here.

443
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:57.150
Deena Larsen: Looking to turn everything off, so we can hear you.

444
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.670
Caitlin Fisher: I think he might be frozen, we might have to might have to restart.

445
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:10.230
Deena Larsen: yeah he may have to restart but at any rate, I think this would be great, so I think the plan going forward with this rest of this year is.

446
00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:22.500
Deena Larsen: For me to experiment Andrew if you want to experiment this year and then present it to your board for next year, and then we start January 2022 and I write up on Saturday, a.

447
00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:42.300
Deena Larsen: Potential proposal for the board and we get it to everyone, would you guys mind putting your emails in either the chat directly to me directly, if you're uncomfortable with having everybody's email or just make sure that I have it, and then I can save the chat and.

448
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.040
Deena Larsen: Get with you guys I don't know how much time we've got are we over time.

449
00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:55.440
Caitlin Fisher: i'm not sure I just wanted to say, there were a couple people who joined a little bit later welcome JEREMY from the west coast where it's all earlier.

450
00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:01.230
Caitlin Fisher: days have been really early starting very early or anybody in La.

451
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:09.000
Caitlin Fisher: But, but just to say that if you're coming late and you're thinking that there are these things happening, the ila salon will still keep its regular time.

452
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:12.630
Caitlin Fisher: it's regular so we're hoping that you will all join the salons we were just.

453
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:28.500
Caitlin Fisher: Expanding on the possibility of that model and thinking about what the Community would want and coming up with some cool ideas for open mics and readings and reading, writing spaces, but the Salon itself is still on the second Tuesday, at the same time, so.

454
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:43.740
Deena Larsen: I am just sort of, and I will talk with mark before I fallen told him, but the first Fridays and discourse are always a little difficult for people to get onto i'm wondering if we could just move that first Friday hangout hey Hello.

455
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.850
Deena Larsen: As one of these as well, that would fill out our four weeks.

456
00:57:50.580 --> 00:58:00.060
Deena Larsen: And yeah Andrew you got to understand I do this for a living, I facilitate for the Federal Government, I facilitate water related discussions in the West.

457
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.440
Deena Larsen: And when we were in person, it literally was check your guns at the door.

458
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:08.940
Deena Larsen: Oh, forgive me for taking over.

459
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.590
Stephanie Strickland: Those going dina that water and.

460
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:15.720
Deena Larsen: Oh, my God.

461
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.520
Deena Larsen: You guys don't even want to know it's.

462
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:22.440
Deena Larsen: it's pretty bad now that we have by i'm not going to get into it, but now that we have a good so.

463
00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:25.680
Deena Larsen: it's a little bit better.

464
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.680
Deena Larsen: But yeah it's it's not pretty.

465
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.010
Deena Larsen: We didn't get the Rio Grande no.

466
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.060
Stephanie Strickland: i'm just saying there's a limit to what discussion can do.

467
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.620
Deena Larsen: No, no, we.

468
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:58.290
Deena Larsen: got we got the pueblos we got the cities of Santa fe and albuquerque and we got everybody on the Rio Grande we got a farmers and we got the watershed groups all together on a plan of study, we can do this for climate change, I was we did that, this week, I was so excited sorry.

469
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:11.610
Deena Larsen: I go no i'm not going to we're going to focus on this we're going to focus on these four ideas somebody was going to say the next session is starting so i'm going to save the chat this has been amazing as usual.

470
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:19.020
Deena Larsen: And thank you guys for all of your presentations and I will save the transcript and the.

471
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.890
Deena Larsen: chat and we will be in touch.

472
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:31.470
Stephanie Strickland: I like to be with Joanna that check your guns at the door is the perfect title for the discussion.

473
00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:34.710
Deena Larsen: Okay.

474
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:42.450
Deena Larsen: If you guys have never been involved in a gun check it's really fun.

475
00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.010
Deena Larsen: yeah.

476
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:47.400
Stephanie Strickland: Unfortunately, we have way too many of them in this country.

477
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.960
Deena Larsen: Yes, we do.

478
00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:58.110
Deena Larsen: But thank you guys so much, and I think we'll figure out the times I know we haven't really put those down down yet caitlin.

479
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.070
Caitlin Fisher: yeah, no, no, I was just more wondering, because we do have Christine here from the UK, so I think part of.

480
01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:17.430
Caitlin Fisher: The idea to salons in this difficult time is you know actually I guess the 11 in the morning actually works pretty well for for Europe it's it's the other time zones, but just it as we imagine new things thinking about ways that.

481
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:27.030
Caitlin Fisher: All things being equal, we could try to stagger times, if these are perfect times for almost everybody will join them that's another consideration, but and.

482
01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:36.120
Deena Larsen: Maybe what we can do I think let's see so I like she was interested in doing one and Sonia and we we could just have an Eastern Asia one.

483
01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.580
Caitlin Fisher: Well she's Waterloo so she's in eastern time I know i'm.

484
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.510
Deena Larsen: Somebody else who's trying for it, then I i'm sorry it's been a rough day.

485
01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:47.010
Caitlin Fisher: yeah yeah no I.

486
01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:47.400
Deena Larsen: don't check.

487
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.710
Caitlin Fisher: Their other time zones to Australia is always like even all of these.

488
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:53.310
Stephanie Strickland: songs.

489
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:57.240
Stephanie Strickland: Do you know, while he is back to see if he can speak oh.

490
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.650
Deena Larsen: Well, he are you there.

491
01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.440
Stephanie Strickland: Maybe that look like you said.

492
01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.350
Deena Larsen: Okay, well, I think the next session is starting and I think I actually have something in the next session so I should get.

493
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.550
Deena Larsen: Like okay.

494
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.680
