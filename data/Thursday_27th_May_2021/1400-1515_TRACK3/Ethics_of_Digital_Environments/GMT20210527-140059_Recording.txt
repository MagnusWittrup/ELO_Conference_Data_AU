00:09:36	Jeremy Hight:	7 am here   good morning
00:09:45	Ben Grosser:	hi jeremy, 9am here
00:12:10	Anna Nacher:	Please type your questions in the chat - we’re gonna have Q&A session after all three presentations.
00:12:24	Anna Nacher:	Hi to everyone here again
00:19:29	Jack Murray:	Still no sound on the trailer
00:19:34	Álvaro Seiça:	Maybe you have to share sound
00:19:39	Álvaro Seiça:	But fine without
00:20:11	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	You have to chose share sound when sharing screen.
00:20:21	Roberta Iadevaia:	at least it's more than 10 seconds ^^
00:24:54	Jeremy Hight:	seeing a connection thus far between the presentations   fascinating
00:25:48	Lauren Rouse (she/they):	Here’s the trailer for those interested! Sorry for the sound issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STh9DodzTZQ
00:26:22	Anna Nacher:	Thank you, @Lauren!
00:29:36	Alan Sondheim:	it also has a lot to do with classical cause-and-effect which cuts through the difficult choice 'fields' in contemporary society -
00:29:46	Jeremy Hight:	interested if the panelists can comment on what thread I am seeing now here.....the need to engage patterns and deeper resonances beyond what we scroll and engage in social media and possibly in passive engagement
00:30:18	Jeremy Hight:	and of course our dystopic times
00:30:55	Anna Nacher:	Thank you, Jeremy, for such an interesting question!
00:32:19	Daniel Cox:	QUESTION: Justin, could you talk more about the complications of working within ARG design spaces when other conspiracy theories exist? Do they ever get co-opted or confused?
00:32:39	Justin Bortnick:	I have a question for Ben when we get through the above questions!
00:33:13	Anna Nacher:	@JUstin Sure, I’m keeping the track :-)
00:35:20	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	I’ve got a question for Ben and Justin.
00:37:41	Mark Sample (he/him):	Doomscrolling for me started in November 2016
00:39:15	Daniel Cox:	QUESTION: Lauren and Rachel - how important are secondary platforms like Reddit for those like Tinder? You mentioned saving screenshots and answers. Do Reddit and other places create communities of users from other platforms to gather those original platforms themselves don't offer or support?
00:39:59	Alan Sondheim:	I've tried to help people break the habit (doom-scrolling) which is also represented by people watching, say, CNN, which creates resonant repetitions through continuous commentary - but re: dystopian - every year I've lived through has been considered dystopian by some -
00:41:19	Mark Sample (he/him):	One of my many takeaways from Lai-Tze’s keynote yesterday is how platforms are engineered to provoke/entice *emotional* response.
00:42:39	Devin:	General question: To what degree are these phenomena adjustable--like, are platforms destined to encourage extreme behavior? Intention seems to come down to attention capture (without concern for other byproducts).
00:46:35	Magdalena Regina Tyzlik-Carver:	Q for Lauren and Rachel: it is fascinating this focus you have on the subversive effects of the game on the possible future choices /matches. I am curious how common was the understanding, among the users, that that their choices in the game might influence their future matches etc. And if and how they responded to it?
00:48:58	Lauren Rouse (she/they):	There’s a great HBO docuseries on Q Anon if you want to learn more about it
00:49:12	Lauren Rouse (she/they):	It’s called Q: Into the Storm
00:49:43	Roberta Iadevaia:	thank you
00:50:41	Christian Ulrik Andersen:	A question for Justin:
Geert Lovink and Ned Rossiter critiqued (a decade ago) the so-called twitter revolutions for being "weak", constructing weak ties between the participants, turning the protest into a carnival, and lacking the organised network of a "real" protest. How does smth like Q-anon (as an ARG) compare to this? If the iterface is integrated into the social and political tissue of a protests – what do you think has changed? Or, are we still seeing the same thing: a protest as a carnival, or "interface spectacle", an endless conspiracy feed, that doesn't really make a change?
00:51:58	Alan Sondheim:	doesn't a lot of what goes on re: Q, goes on behind the scene? not a spectacle, but intense privacy including real-life face to face...
00:52:22	Alan Sondheim:	Sartre relates here, Levinas, etc., fwiw -
00:54:04	Jeremy Hight:	had a student a few years ago  who fell into q anon by his fascination with numerology and what was happening behind the spectacle aspect
00:57:05	Alan Sondheim:	but the 2nd shooter re: Kennedy spread rapidly thru the media as well -
00:57:12	Jeremy Hight:	yes  the tide pools  or corners of platforms aspect
01:00:57	Jeremy Hight:	silicon valley has a big demand for psych majors the last few years...partially for the seemingly infinite and connected incentification/bread crumbs
01:02:46	Alan Sondheim:	but there were also posters, ballads, rumors, coffeehouses, and so forth; also give the addictions to CNN (I know a lot of people who behave accordingly) - it doesn't need to be scrolling, it can be repetitive in other ways....
01:03:05	Lauren Rouse (she/they):	Chun’s work: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/control-and-freedom
01:03:29	Marjorie Luesebrink:	thanks for this nterestig discussion!
01:03:30	Alan Sondheim:	an absolutely great book!
01:03:52	Christian Ulrik Andersen:	… simple “persuasive psychology” (pop psychology). turned into a cultural form….
01:04:38	Ben Grosser:	I was also referring to Chun’s Updating to Remain the Same
01:04:47	Ben Grosser:	Geert’s quote is from Sad by Design
01:05:37	Daniel Cox:	QUESTION: Lauren and Rachel - do you see the hypertextual approaches to platforms like Swipe Night as more helpful than hurtful for those seeking out matches using Tinder? That is, does/did its game-part succeed for those using it for the purpose of finding matches?
01:05:48	Alan Sondheim:	apologies, have to go
01:05:57	Alan Sondheim:	wonderful discussion!
01:06:01	Ben Grosser:	by alan
01:06:03	Justin Bortnick:	Thanks for your comments!
01:06:04	Ben Grosser:	bye :)
01:09:44	Devin:	Thanks!
01:13:04	Søren Bro Pold (he, him):	I will unfortunately also have to leave this fascinating discussion (getting ready for the moderation of the keynote). See you!
01:13:15	Ben Grosser:	bye soren, thx for your question!
01:13:21	Anna Nacher:	Thanks, Soren, see you!
01:17:32	Christian Ulrik Andersen:	Yes, I recommend Anna’s article… :-)
01:23:03	Christian Ulrik Andersen:	… and how the two movements imagine social “change”, too.
01:23:28	Rachel Winter:	Thanks, Anna!
01:23:33	Christian Ulrik Andersen:	Thanks for a great panel and great questions/comments
01:23:34	Lauren Rouse (she/they):	Thanks, Anna!
