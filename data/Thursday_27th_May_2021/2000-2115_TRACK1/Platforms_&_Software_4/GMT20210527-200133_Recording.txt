00:27:37	Jeremy Hight:	to be
00:30:58	Andrew Klobucar:	You might be e-lit and not even know it…
00:32:30	Anna Nacher:	you don’t know you spoke e-lit the whole life
00:32:51	Jeremy Hight:	will be interested in also  works not under the specific umbrella but of its parameters....architecture, semiotics,  spatial study,  poetics
00:33:01	Scott Rettberg:	Awesome!
00:33:02	Melinda White (she/her):	Student work?
00:33:05	Jeremy Hight:	e lit?  you are soaking in it
00:33:11	Jeremy Hight:	yes student work absolutely
00:33:18	Anna Nacher:	drenched in e-lit
00:33:35	Melinda White (she/her):	immersed. Digitally swimming in it
00:33:42	Sarah Ciston (she/they):	So thrilled to hear about this and to share this with select students and colleagues <3
00:33:47	Johannah Rodgers:	I worked on a site-specific writing project in 2016 in a park in NE Brooklyn that I’d love to consider remixing and updating for reverb!
00:34:11	Johannah Rodgers:	This is great!
00:34:19	Siobhan O'Flynn:	Exciting!

00:40:45	Scott Rettberg:	I love all of thins innovative use of freely available and accessible tools. Wonderful way to do an e-lit class!
00:41:14	Johannah Rodgers:	What is the name of the timeline tool?
00:41:43	Inge van de Ven:	Amazing work, I loved reading your paper, esp the way Twine accommodates marginalized narratives.
00:41:44	Siobhan O'Flynn:	thank you!

00:49:03	Jeremy Hight:	Andrew how has the sense of space and sound first driven your proposal and evolved in the process thus far?
00:50:04	Jeremy Hight:	I can read a novel in a few hours.. a blessing and a curse
00:52:57	Scott Rettberg:	:  )
00:54:33	Scott Rettberg:	Great comment though, Margie!
00:54:44	Jeremy Hight:	my e lit and critical thinking students really respond to :  Garfield without Garfield, Nietzsche family circus and choose your own adventure books
00:57:04	Andrew Klobucar:	Newark has quite a history!
00:58:09	Jeremy Hight:	http://www.nietzschefamilycircus.com/
00:58:30	Jeremy Hight:	randomly combines family circus cartoon and nietzsche
00:59:00	Sarah Ciston (she/they):	would help write / would buy that collection, I’ll second that
00:59:15	Anna Nacher:	Great idea indeed.
01:00:40	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	Maybe something like this for Scott’s book
01:00:43	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/669487/code-as-creative-medium-by-golan-levin-and-tega-brain/
01:01:27	Jeremy Hight:	ah locative narrative  my baby
01:01:28	Johannah Rodgers:	@andrewD That would be great!  It can be housed on the ELO website.
01:02:38	Jeremy Hight:	great question...been interesting seeing locative works change since mine back in 2001  in the old days
01:04:58	Jeremy Hight:	exactly  with  34 north  118 west we wanted a more gestural interface but was not possible...I called it the bowling alley conundrum
01:05:15	Melinda White (she/her):	it’s so fun to see them take off with the branching narratives in Twine!
01:09:20	Jennifer Dellner:	I wonder if Anna’s question also has to do with Inge’s paper: do students of print literature, even experimental literature, have a specific sense of attention modulation driven by an assumed, sub-conscious sense of rules of notice that they have absorbed over time?
01:09:34	Sarah Ciston (she/they):	I love this question. With teaching beginning coders and hybrid lit, I try to share my own skepticism and fears; and then actually go deeper into that conversation, what is the criteria, what are the gatekeepers, what are the approaches that help lower the barriers, etc.
01:09:51	Johannah Rodgers:	@Jennifer +1
01:10:22	Patrick Lichty:	For my e-lit projects in the UAE, I only had Animation, Fine Art and Interior design majors
01:10:30	Inge van de Ven:	interesting suggestion Jennifer! I actuallythink they do
01:11:10	Patrick Lichty:	I just gave them different sorts of sotrytelling relevant to their majors. Went well.
01:12:14	Anna Nacher:	Yes, Jennifer is spot on - it may be more difficult to unteach them literary than teach e-lit
01:12:31	Melinda White (she/her):	The narrative arc is strongly ingrained
01:13:01	Anna Nacher:	so to reconfigure the question: do we have any tools so that students could unlearn better :-)
01:13:30	Johannah Rodgers:	@Anna your question makes me wonder if may be best not to separate elit from print-based literature that is “media aware”
01:14:06	Anna Nacher:	but their whole training is based on such a separation
01:14:08	Jeremy Hight:	perhaps  to unlearn  purely external complication as narrative
01:14:13	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	My thought on Anna’s question is that if you can use examples from games or situations that they can relate to and then show how an e-lit experimental idea can be seen in contemporary texts
01:14:17	Anna Nacher:	that’s why I’m saying about unteaching and unlearning
01:14:18	Andrew Klobucar:	Very interesting question: does interactivity as a narrative component play into this question: Gamers tend to say the works don’t play as well as they are used to; while literary students say they are too interactive…
01:14:40	Jennifer Dellner:	@Andrew K: yes, exactly. I think it does
01:14:46	Jeremy Hight:	my students increasingly have ingrained a sense of quest as narrative
01:15:04	Jeremy Hight:	it is problematic
01:15:08	Jennifer Dellner:	Yes, Jeremy: they are flummoxed without a quest!
01:15:12	Andrew Klobucar:	I’ve had better success by making interactivity a focus to be analyzed
01:15:24	Patrick Lichty:	What is your favorite color?
01:15:35	Jeremy Hight:	mauve
01:15:41	Anna Nacher:	fuchsia
01:15:53	Andrew Klobucar:	brown
01:15:59	Patrick Lichty:	You may pass!
01:16:46	Anna Nacher:	Pass for what?
01:17:40	Johannah Rodgers:	@Anna certainly, but that is based on a specific cultural narrative around what literary study is; if you started the course with Aarseth’s “cybertext” as a frame, you could potentially alter the cultural narrative around literature as a print based discipline or around interactivity as the domain of electronic media
01:19:04	Anna Nacher:	I eventually did that; my questions are also rhetoric to some extent - I think we too often assume the students would be necessarily thrilled by e-lit :-)
01:19:05	talia devanadero:	re: Andrew's comment on making interactivity a focus to be analyzed:i'm an undergrad, but my high school English curriculum was very traditionalwe did, however, talk about reader-response theory and interactivity, and it was very helpful in distancing our analysis from things like the hero's journey and metaphor into how medium shapes our takeaways
01:19:18	Johannah Rodgers:	lol
01:20:36	Carlota Salvador Megias:	@agnieszka, i really like the way you set up your course! (esp. the idea of tracing how we get from “traditional” literary uses of maps to the ways we use maps to storytell in elit)
01:20:40	Anna Nacher:	And the funniest outcome of this problematic class was their final project - a wonderful Twine interactive story that could be published, no doubt about it :-)
01:20:47	Davin Heckman:	That is helpful, Johanna, Anna, Talia…
01:21:21	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	@thanks Carlota!
01:21:22	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	context collapse - Danah Boyd I believe
01:21:27	Johannah Rodgers:	@anna fascinating!
01:21:50	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	@Anna - and it is a wonderful text :-)
01:21:52	Anna Nacher:	I guess my point is we don’t talk about problems often enough - the reaction of the class came as a surprise to me and to my guests :-) which in the end proved to be a very creative situation
01:22:57	Jeremy Hight:	my friend years ago in her ma  in creative writing taught  a course that was boot camp for young writers...  was controversial but was basically why why why    before ok go
01:23:07	Melinda White (she/her):	My students love The Fall because they can swipe
01:23:20	Anna Nacher:	as creativity is often strongly connected to a bit of tension in the classroom :-) I just realized how we tend to stick to the comfortable, even when teaching uncomfortable avant-garde :-)
01:23:21	talia devanadero:	i feel very called out as one of these gen z students with split screen tabs open
01:23:33	Andrew Klobucar:	I agree… Anna; it’s a ripe area for exploration…
01:23:47	Jennifer Dellner:	So true
01:24:00	Johannah Rodgers:	@talia fear not!  I would imagine just about everyone in this seminar has more than 20 tabs open.
01:24:04	Melinda White (she/her):	Yes, they need to be a bit uncomfortable/vulnerable
01:24:12	Inge van de Ven:	but even in  browsing social media there must be some rhythm, and maybe some kind of 'Punctum' where your eye lands on a certain snippet of info and you get sucked in?
01:24:26	Jeremy Hight:	I have twenty tabs open in each of two browsers right now
01:24:28	Anna Nacher:	and we need to be a bit vulnerable/uncomfortable I guess :-)
01:24:47	Jennifer Dellner:	@Inge: Concept of a “punctum” seems important here; agreed
01:24:48	Melinda White (she/her):	haha yes. always
01:25:00	Andrew Klobucar:	In the 1990s, I always closed my tabs… now it’s gone to hell…
01:25:15	Davin Heckman:	I do think that question of vulnerability is very important!
01:25:27	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	@Anna, students of Polish literature link e-lit to blogs and Shuty's "Blok". If they are studing literature and prefer literary storytelling that games/movies you need to start with showing how literariness can still exist in new media environment. Otherway they will say "no" to everything. It is also problem of lack of good "literary" e-lit examples you can use in class.
01:26:33	Anna Nacher:	@Agnieszka, the problem is not about the lack of “literary” e-lit but about the very concept of what counts as “literary” as you know all too well
01:26:53	Christopher C. Odom (He/Him/His♂️):	Engagement = [Audience x Desire] / [Creative Intent x Design]
01:27:24	Andrew Klobucar:	Close vs distant reading was a popular discussion topic in the aughts…
01:27:39	Jeremy Hight:	I had students tell me  story of an hour  by kate chopin was too long...our copy was two pages
01:28:54	Johannah Rodgers:	Re: this topic of reading and distraction, I always find Hayle’s 2010 essay “How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine”: https://www.ade.mla.org/bulletin/article/ade.150.62
01:29:16	Jeremy Hight:	as  a young multimedia prof I had my class watch koyanasqatsi in full no breaks  in a bungalow in july with no a.c   I should send them sympathy cards
01:29:52	Inge van de Ven:	well said
01:30:06	Davin Heckman:	I think a lot of attention is being channelled into conspiracy….
01:30:23	Davin Heckman:	If only people read Pynchon or something.
01:30:26	Jennifer Dellner:	I didn’t mean to suggest that Oh, kids these days, no attention. I was more interested in how print  (any kind of print) modulates attention/presents different rules of notice than  e-lit, any kind of elit.
01:30:27	Jeremy Hight:	this is becoming a very therapeutic discussion
01:30:46	Jeremy Hight:	in the best way
01:30:50	Jennifer Dellner:	Lol, David, Pynchon
01:30:57	Jennifer Dellner:	*Davin
01:31:12	Davin Heckman:	;)
01:31:40	Laura Hyunjhee Kim (she/her):	+1 @Jeremy “therapeutic” — also have held a similar @koyanasqatsi exercise in class before lol
01:31:41	Jeremy Hight:	gravity's rainbow to be read by day one and performed with puppets
01:31:51	Johannah Rodgers:	http://www.stephaniestrickland.com/vniverse
01:31:53	Jeremy Hight:	lol  nice
01:32:30	Melinda White (she/her):	My favorite class I taught in grad school was pomo and e-lit structure, all Pynchon and Cortazar alongside the e-lit.
01:32:47	Andrew Klobucar:	Finnegans wake with non-stop Irish Whiskey
01:32:56	Anna Nacher:	<3 Stephanie
01:32:57	Laura Hyunjhee Kim (she/her):	“Honors different languages that resonate with you” — love <3
01:33:03	Jeremy Hight:	cortazar  that sounds amazing
01:33:36	Jennifer Dellner:	@Andrew K: you’re on. There is also a Finnegan’s wake Twitter and it is so odd to experience it chopped up that way
01:34:07	Johannah Rodgers:	https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world
01:34:16	talia devanadero:	my class also looked at queers in love at the end of the world, it certainly left an impression
01:34:18	Davin Heckman:	To reflect on your comment Stephanie…. I’d be interested in knowing how many print writers are also very open to how people might read their work.  So many reading habits that people have.
01:34:31	Jeremy Hight:	my friend tim wright places Joyce in a google map of Dublin....forget the link now
01:34:56	Anna Nacher:	Thank you, all for such an interesting discussion, gotta go!
01:34:59	Melinda White (she/her):	digital Dubliners?
01:35:08	Johannah Rodgers:	Bye @Anna!  Great to see you!!!!!
01:35:11	Siobhan O'Flynn:	https://philome.la/Twinegames2017U/sirens-song/index.html
01:35:22	Anna Nacher:	Bye @JOhannah, likewise!
01:35:23	Andrew Klobucar:	See you @Anna. Very good to see you
01:35:36	Anna Nacher:	Great to see you, @Andrew
01:35:41	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	See you @Anna. Good to see you
01:37:17	Andrew Klobucar:	Reminds me of that YouTube video where a monk tries to make sense of a print book, not knowing how to “work it”
01:37:50	Johannah Rodgers:	It is too bad that George is not here since I believe he was going to present on Netflix as elit?
01:38:00	Jennifer Dellner:	Yes, he was.
01:38:10	Christopher C. Odom (He/Him/His♂️):	I was looking forward to George’s presentation.
01:38:17	Melinda White (she/her):	Yes! I watched that Kimmy Scmidt show. haha
01:38:27	Astrid:	Me too, @Christopher
01:38:33	Johannah Rodgers:	I like to think of Netflix as a 21st c. recreation of serialized fiction in the 19th c.
01:39:08	talia devanadero:	https://nickm.com/laufer_montfort/the_bug/index.html
01:39:39	Siobhan O'Flynn:	Melinda - we look at Cortazar, “A Continuity of Parks”
01:39:41	Inge van de Ven:	excellent point Talia! I think there's something to experiences that are not 'on demand' that can be very powerful
01:39:43	Andrew Klobucar:	Good insights, Talia.
01:40:02	Jennifer Dellner:	Thank you, Talia!
01:40:02	Melinda White (she/her):	Siobhan, I love that one! I taught Hopscotch a couple of times, I love it!
01:40:08	Siobhan O'Flynn:	Nice!
01:40:41	Jennifer Dellner:	I am laughing, though, @Talia, because you only think you can watch whatever you want when you want: so much disappears from streaming suddenly and then there is a scramble to find it elsewhere
01:40:55	Johannah Rodgers:	Thanks everyone!
01:40:56	Amanda Hodes:	Thanks everyone! This was great
01:40:57	Agnieszka Przybyszewska:	wonderful pane, thanks for the discusion!
01:41:00	talia devanadero:	@jennifer that's the case with fanfic ;)
01:41:04	Andrew Demirjian he/him:	thank you devin
01:41:13	Melinda White (she/her):	Thank you Devin and everyone!
01:41:18	Jeremy Hight:	I made a free nft of Kafka's metamorphosis as a conversation with alexa
01:41:28	Siobhan O'Flynn:	I have ti jump into a meeting!
01:41:35	Siobhan O'Flynn:	Thank you!
01:41:37	Davin Heckman:	Thank you, everyone!
01:41:45	Jennifer Dellner:	Thank you!
