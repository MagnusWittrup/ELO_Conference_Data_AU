Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Coming from a school and university, where one of the greatest with this was being silent was not so easy for me to speak for myself.

15
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:32.040
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: That master's degree was not just about subjects to study assignments and readings, it was made up of discussions informs.

16
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:46.080
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Our own reflection of reading electronically to town sharing every discovery with classmates from all around the world, learning from teachers, but also from each other.

17
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:56.190
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: The masters change the way our land, as you can see, it also changed the way I teach my high high school talent.

18
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:16.770
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Considering that I proposed to a teacher training Center teaching a basic training course, on reading on screens that included electronically Twitter, I am presenting an overview of the six courses I taught from 2015 to 2021.

19
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.920
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: While teaching is not easy let's take a moment to think about the teaching and learning process, you are involved with.

20
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:46.800
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: This overview of my teaching six to be very close to understand as customer defines it as teaching is a human practice tied to a central institution such as this school is as well, half experience it during the lockdown.

21
00:04:49.380 --> 00:05:03.720
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: So all the data I am consenting should only be used to try to understand what we find these politicians of the course where the sign i'm taught by myself, while I was still in high school.

22
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:19.110
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I brought this contents to the teacher training team when I become advisor we design our brother tool based course in with literary digital content was only in the first part.

23
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:32.640
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: The purpose of the courses, I thought was providing teachers are view from the humanities, to the digital and discover what role literary reading has in the digital age.

24
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:58.320
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: It is fair to say that there have been some other courses, with a similar approach since 2020 as you see this humanistic approach, with or without digital literacy is practically insignificant in detail training online courses or Fred during the last year's.

25
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:08.220
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: The question is, how do you make sense of the numbers and the teaching experiences that delay behind them.

26
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:21.090
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: When I was looking for me blow rafi for better understanding, I found that fortunately there already studies on how digital data is received by stallions.

27
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:33.720
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Guided by groups of experts and the complexity of teachers setter as those of the greater group and the ones of readers Anna Maria Machado, and albuquerque.

28
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:44.910
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: That did also in 20 a teacher training course and forgive me if I do not have enough time to quote more carefully these and other examples, we have.

29
00:06:46.200 --> 00:07:01.650
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: On the other hand, I found that especially from 2018 studies done by university research groups on digital reading compare reading comprehension on screen and on paper in young students.

30
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:18.090
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Conclusions occupy headlines in the press, telling parents and teachers, that obviously reading on paper is much more significant, but none of these studies include digital.

31
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.720
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Professor john Elliott has developed.

32
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:41.700
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Working with reality that incorporates the dialogue between theory and practice at is hurt the action research approach it includes collaborative work between teachers have different levels looking for building siri.

33
00:07:45.720 --> 00:08:03.180
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: This abroad, which has never white been widely incorporated into schools becomes more alive in the light of digital literacy and digital content in where theory and practice should be very close.

34
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:16.950
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: What I did was designed for the courses are virtual classroom that emulated they are working in path that I had experienced assistant in the masters.

35
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:37.590
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: detective sergeant stated as goals to achieve now I realize that there were were values that I wanted to put in the Center of a group of teachers, not everything in my course was miserable achievement of those goals.

36
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.790
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: But traced, a path of dialogue.

37
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.490
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Without the images in the way with that path is designed for for learning.

38
00:08:51.810 --> 00:09:03.600
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: It was organized in three lessons moving teachers from a general discussion about using technology in the classroom to this specific digital digital content and a final assignment.

39
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.260
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: essential for me to include was.

40
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.940

41
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:30.000
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Within articles is personalized and informative and discussing them in follows some examples, including digital activities done by me, without forums to motivate the feeling of our ability.

42
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:41.400
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: If another teacher has done it, they can do it too soon online reset in a formal leaving and enter in the classroom with new content to share.

43
00:09:42.870 --> 00:10:03.840
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Within electronically Twitter and sharing the experience in forums and it was compulsory to assign an assignment related digital tools and little feedback and assessment were shared in the follow as an opportunity to for improvement and rewriting or completing the assignment ethnicity.

44
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.040
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: In that way, the contents change along the years but not the learning path.

45
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:21.090
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: As you can see, in my editions forums prevailed, with the advisor steam forums were held in the first part.

Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Teachers read some of them now lost in Catalan, including the translation some English too.

50
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.270
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Often electronic lita was for me the strongest point of the course.

51
00:10:50.070 --> 00:11:05.040
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: flow the work at their own pace and commented on them in the forums where I could assist them if they if they needed all data view of an elite work with personnel not yet fit feedback.

52
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:13.650
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Some information from the details reading and discussing electronic lita good guidance for future teaching.

53
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.410
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Electronic literature for my teachers is a hard thing to find if you don't know where to set.

54
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.250
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: It has a great surprise effect.

55
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:36.540
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: opens up perspectives on Lisa that are unique and not necessarily linked to social media or tools.

56
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.610
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: suggest connections with other now let's and this appliance.

57
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:50.400
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: puts into play the reading skills that teachers have taking them to the limit of an extra effort of comprehension.

58
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:58.260
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: sets in motion a process of teacher empathy for students as teachers feel like learners.

59
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.500
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: contains lots of the tactic, but insanities that teachers can see immediately.

60
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:12.450
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: highlights the aspect of digital creation and makes teachers want to know how to create.

61
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:24.120
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: brings back important questions that the teacher routine makes us forget to do I reflect on again set as what is lita always lead.

62
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:44.670
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: You have some teachers comments after reading it works, I have more than than 30 pages of forums comments and 164 reviews on digital etc works from teachers and 99% positive.

63
00:12:47.700 --> 00:13:04.680
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: From my point of view, integrating the humanistic approach for digital literacy and reading and understanding electronically to town in schools and high schools opens the possibility as earlier to remarks of theorizing from the standpoint of action.

64
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:20.790
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: In addition, we contribute to building a conscious digital culture that can be appropriated integrated and therefore dance form by teachers and consequently later bye bye students.

65
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.140
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: We also doing studying as teachers to baylor.

66
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:43.140
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Being together is the first step for being couple good to go for what into a classroom and then go ahead with electronic later creation translation and dissemination opening up new spaces for reflection from practice.

67
00:13:44.640 --> 00:14:06.540
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Having been generalize it the opinion that really not screens is a superficial action even been sometimes qualified as unfold in offering electronic leads us to our teachers will return them to an earlier stage to this stage of relearning how to read literary works.

68
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:22.050
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Besides, two different engagements operating them while reading it as Hayes notice first an intense and concentrated attention at different points hipper attention.

69
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:40.260
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: And second a deep and sustained attention in more or less long and recurrent periods and in depth it fought specially in trying trying to understand the global sense of our work, the potential.

70
00:14:42.750 --> 00:15:00.750
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Reading elite is are demanding cognitive exercise that values that additional reading baggage of teachers, meanwhile, teachers, combine it with own screen reading strategies that they have learned in video games social media or web surfing.

71
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:23.790
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: We need to delete that is not is not perceived by teachers as a superficial reading one time they have read electronic later, on the contrary, they evaluate as a difficult exercise we really know that that as a strategy, a strategy, they use several times.

72
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:34.740
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Electronic later represents as well, I read field where didactic Sapir very quickly, as these words can be used to as tools.

73
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:53.520
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: for different purposes, like learning languages creation discussing the time contents and more, but the most important thing is that that reading experience affect positively teachers values and beliefs.

74
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:06.810
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: But only to teachers out of the 87 that complete the day courses chose digital literacy for the final assignment.

75
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.650
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: If they like electronic liters so much did they not there to propose it in class.

76
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:35.790
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I wonder what would happen in a course entirely designed for teaching digital literacy for school teachers with reflection time pause rereading shane scaffolding carefully not starting from the boyd helping to climb back from our religion traditions, to visit allison.

77
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:49.800
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I never thought that this content was to specific or expert to offer to teachers who did studies from six to 17 years old, because I was addicted to.

78
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:59.880
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Digital leaders, that is to priests us not to be cultivate in a wider range, along with artists and expert reset is.

79
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:16.680
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: As they potentially dressers is highly revolutionary in aspects related to religion and others regarding cultures and languages, not mentioned in the ones about social beliefs and misunderstanding about really not screens.

80
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:29.280
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: did indeed digitally to tie in schools could perhaps help help pass to redefine their religion relationship between know let an action in the academic.

81
00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:43.560
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: In your youth wards intellectual modal reflection is the one with the shapes our educational system in the West, on what counts as reset in the acronym.

82
00:17:44.700 --> 00:18:01.020
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Pure activity of thought which is cool passionless and completely disinterested this interested seeking through for its own sake, with no way to the practical at bank advantage for the seeker or for anyone else.

83
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:16.560
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: It is impossible for the knowledge produced by this type of or off reflection to make any direct link with the experience of those who want to effect change in the world.

84
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.280
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:49.740
Perla Sasson-Henry: This one just a tiny bit and then, if and killer cannot recognize, I will start and maybe she can proceed just after me as well.

126
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.660
Perla Sasson-Henry: If you don't know project I might.

127
00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.360
See.

128
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:25.680
Perla Sasson-Henry: Okay, I think, so as not to to lose this precious time that we have here, I might go ahead with my presentation and maybe until I can compensate right after me.

129
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:36.120
Perla Sasson-Henry: So on so that we still have time later for for a open in the forum for questions, so let me go ahead and try to share my screen to.

130
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.540
Perla Sasson-Henry: Okay, so.

131
00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:07.230
Perla Sasson-Henry: You can you see the screen here, yes, if you can so well Good morning, my name is by last one Henry I am a professor of the Spanish a day in the department of.

132
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:22.050
Perla Sasson-Henry: languages and cultures at the United States naval Academy, the title of my presentation, as you can see elite new perspectives for teaching and learning a foreign languages, especially Spanish in my case and cultures.

133
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:33.030
Perla Sasson-Henry: So it was back in 2007 that they participated in the symposium the future of electronic literature.

134
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:41.190
Perla Sasson-Henry: And an event organized by the electronic literature organization and the Maryland institute for technology in the humanities.

135
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:49.230
Perla Sasson-Henry: One of the main concepts of the event was to highlight the presence and relevance of international electronic literature.

136
00:25:49.680 --> 00:26:00.960
Perla Sasson-Henry: In an attempt to promote elite works in various languages other than English an international panel of scholars presented works in French Catalan Nordic languages.

137
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:17.130
Perla Sasson-Henry: And they also highlighted the fact that electronic literature is a global movement by that time there were a considerable number of it works in Spanish, which had not reach a wider audience I had already published an article.

138
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:34.140
Perla Sasson-Henry: On the intruder by natalie booth pin which took up a hothead with board has a short story line towson and it remediated it into a net art a work with a.

139
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:40.410
Perla Sasson-Henry: With a navigation system with a platform that simulated arcade games of the 80s.

140
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:51.990
Perla Sasson-Henry: And so, by that time I thought I realized the potential that elite could have to engage the students in the learning of Spanish language literature and culture.

141
00:26:52.500 --> 00:27:00.810
Perla Sasson-Henry: bookings work was just the beginning to what would be a long list of filler words in Spanish, which have been emerging in the last decade.

142
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:12.660
Perla Sasson-Henry: In the summer of 2007 there was an article on in a limited way loneliness or minus right the first the Wright brothers first flight.

143
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:21.900
Perla Sasson-Henry: By Columbia and writer Gutierrez in this work, which resembles a hopscotch know, as you can see the the.

144
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:37.440
Perla Sasson-Henry: design, not a trs takes us to the idiosyncrasies of a small town a in Colombia idiosyncrasies that mark the big gap between classes.

145
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:48.510
Perla Sasson-Henry: The power of the Church, the power of the of the government by this time of his students had already been introduced to Jorge always bought his ideas.

146
00:27:48.930 --> 00:28:05.400
Perla Sasson-Henry: On the reader the right or the text by reading the garden of 14 path and they had also been introduced to hula dancers, a hopscotch trash trailer and they could relate all these ideas to to eat as well.

147
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:20.730
Perla Sasson-Henry: So electronic literature in Spanish, and your perspective in that to the study of the cultures of the Spanish speaking world we're finally came to fruition to fruition in the year 2017.

148
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:32.250
Perla Sasson-Henry: And it was a taught at the United States naval Academy for urine for spring semesters it was a special topics course at the 400 level.

149
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:41.640
Perla Sasson-Henry: And it's important to highlight that the United States naval academy is the undergraduate college of the United States naval service.

150
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.910
Perla Sasson-Henry: it prepares the students to become professional officers of competence characters and compassion in the US navy and marine corps.

151
00:28:51.450 --> 00:29:00.150
Perla Sasson-Henry: Only shipment that what we call the students at our institution graduate from the United States naval Academy, with a bachelor degree of science.

152
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:13.920
Perla Sasson-Henry: After four years when they are commissioned as an instance in the navy or second lieutenants in the marine corps they served in the navy all over the world, with different navy's or the Marine corps for at least five years.

153
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:27.420
Perla Sasson-Henry: So electronic literature as discourse a for the for the teaching of language Spanish as a foreign language and the culture of the Spanish speaking world.

154
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:44.820
Perla Sasson-Henry: was also aligned with the mission and the goals of the languages and cultures, a department to produce graduates who possess a fundamental understanding of foreign languages and societies from the wasted literary culture and geopolitical perspectives.

155
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:57.450
Perla Sasson-Henry: So what, what are the course goes to develop knowledge, skills and techniques in reading and understanding challenging electronic works in Spanish in various genres.

156
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:07.200
Perla Sasson-Henry: To be able to express that knowledge in the form of essays and ordered presentations that demonstrated the students research skills and language abilities.

157
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:23.280
Perla Sasson-Henry: To improve our students proficiency in developing abstract ideas and alessi literary evidence in Spanish, to reflect on how the new digital tours enhanced the dissemination of historical and cultural aspects of the Spanish speaking world.

158
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:41.790
Perla Sasson-Henry: So who were the students, so the students were 80% of them come from the stem majors science, technology engineering and math So you can see that there are ocean engineering naval architecture in.

159
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:51.900
Perla Sasson-Henry: robotics cyber operations computer science 20% of the students are in the humanities are wearing the humanities and social sciences.

160
00:30:52.830 --> 00:31:00.870
Perla Sasson-Henry: For example, a we call them Arabic, is a major at the naval academy Chinese is a major Spanish is not a major.

161
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:15.090
Perla Sasson-Henry: English political science history and economics, so the methodology follows a content based approach without this regarding the inclusion of a combative see based approach, as suggested by sound.

162
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:26.550
Perla Sasson-Henry: I think that we were both teaching a elite in Spanish, at the same time, but with a different type of a students not.

163
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:39.870
Perla Sasson-Henry: So I had to move forward to to increase their linguistic skills their cultural knowledge of the world, now, and so the approach that is some proposes emphasizes reading.

164
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:49.710
Perla Sasson-Henry: The literature as building designing touching on or listening this course introduce relevant topics pertaining to the Spanish speaking world.

165
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:59.790
Perla Sasson-Henry: We are elite works in Spanish and Sam in English, to be discussed in Spanish, this approach, a low to the for the study of the Spanish as a foreign language and culture.

166
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:08.100
Perla Sasson-Henry: In an environment that was expected to is to improve the students linguistic skills cultural knowledge and digital business.

167
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:20.400
Perla Sasson-Henry: So the challenges the challenges, a word that reading elite in Spanish require a new understanding of literature, the text the reader an author.

168
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.740
Perla Sasson-Henry: As well as new vocabulary to express those new concepts in a foreign language.

169
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:40.800
Perla Sasson-Henry: Students became familiar and analyze it in different forms hypermedia novels blog novels poetry Twitter at your net drops gods, among others, this presentation does not include all the types of.

170
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:53.280
Perla Sasson-Henry: genres and activities that were included in that in those courses some his students, develop a small elite project based on the knowledge they have from their science or humanities majors.

171
00:32:53.610 --> 00:33:01.680
Perla Sasson-Henry: In that way, they are reflected on the new paradigms presented in the course which call for reading as building and designing whenever possible.

172
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:14.730
Perla Sasson-Henry: So, as the years went by so there were more sources and resources for the students to do their research in Spanish or in English and to have access to more.

173
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:24.810
Perla Sasson-Henry: Material the course started with two readings by lunar the florist letter to the electronic or your food to develop an average case literature electronica.

174
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:41.850
Perla Sasson-Henry: and students from the very beginning, were asked to work in pairs to pick a work from the electronic literature collection and to present the main characteristics of these works to the class, we also had other.

175
00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:56.010
Perla Sasson-Henry: sources of information and and works like this central with while Cervantes in is also the MC which provided valuable resources of elite works and critical so.

176
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:12.810
Perla Sasson-Henry: As the years went by there were also more essays bobbi parish more critical work publish publish in Spanish, and even a curling against us a book narrative as poetic as it is in America Latina.

177
00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:25.290
Perla Sasson-Henry: it's an open source book and the students referred to eat for their research as well, more resources were coming up in the Center local dial.

178
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:39.480
Perla Sasson-Henry: The Center of the call today we hit dial in Mexico City also provides invaluable source of a it works and critical essays for the students and to do their their research.

179
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:49.710
Perla Sasson-Henry: So let's discuss some of the of the works that were included in in some of the iterations of this.

180
00:34:50.280 --> 00:35:02.520
Perla Sasson-Henry: All of these courses, as I mentioned before, one of the first a pioneer works affiliate in Spanish is element, while others or minus right the first flight of the right products by one big ups.

181
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:12.450
Perla Sasson-Henry: These work hard different iterations and it approximates the reader to the idiosyncrasies, as I mentioned before, of this model Colombian town.

182
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:22.410
Perla Sasson-Henry: And these features can be very but will apply to many other small towns all throughout Latin America and Central America, no.

183
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:30.510
Perla Sasson-Henry: And there was also that a this feeling that the plane was arriving and it was the advent of technology in a smaller town.

184
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:46.350
Perla Sasson-Henry: That face a feeling of incredulity among the inhabitants, so we discuss also the advent of the new technologies in our societies, the opinions that Latin Americans have a about the the advent of new technologies.

185
00:35:47.310 --> 00:36:02.550
Perla Sasson-Henry: Also, we continued our syllabus with condition as extreme as the first elite science fiction in Spanish Why was this a this work chosen, because who am able to rest takes us to a.

187
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:28.080

00:46:49.860 --> 00:47:02.850
Perla Sasson-Henry: And we have a sample here, so the challenge was that the this machine, not that a it gave us language in English, of course, the students didn't know or this vocabulary so.

236
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:20.790
Perla Sasson-Henry: They had to look it up, they had to see what it what it meant, and they have to create a narrative respond to other people, they could upload a sound a file, they could upload they actually uploaded a video towards the towards the end they created the final project.

237
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:28.920
Perla Sasson-Henry: This and you can see how the students are producing a lot of language in Spanish, and they also communicate in English.

238
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:48.990
Perla Sasson-Henry: So we did another one one step forward two steps back this was based on Twitter, so the students created their avatars and this net profit was about being fit and what different applications would help us to be fit the students engaged in this, and they will enjoy.

239
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.870
Perla Sasson-Henry: So then came.

240
00:47:53.070 --> 00:48:05.940
Perla Sasson-Henry: bots what do we do with bots, and so the students, they have come across bots but they didn't know that both would also help us to learn about society protest, so we came across.

241
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:13.860
Perla Sasson-Henry: You know the florist protest status which takes us to Puerto Rico and different cultural situations.

242
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:24.570
Perla Sasson-Henry: And the abuse of women, the government know we also a experience, who that can about the hurricane and.

243
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:34.860
Perla Sasson-Henry: in Puerto Rico and we were very lucky to have professor, you know, the floor is a he came to our institution to give a.

244
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:45.810
Perla Sasson-Henry: lecture and he also gave a workshop a workshop to the students were a Dr Flores and the students created a preliminary version of taco hell.

245
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:56.130
Perla Sasson-Henry: which creates a speculative a items menu to parody taco bell's convenient audio menu items, so this was very interesting for the students as well.

246
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:08.280
Perla Sasson-Henry: So, towards the end of the semester we couldn't omit a medium ncs a narrative poetic narrative elbert coalesce better answer it takes us.

247
00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:21.540
Perla Sasson-Henry: Is the relationship between Spain and Latin America is the rescue of 2200 refugees who a go into into France.

248
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:32.220
Perla Sasson-Henry: After the Spanish Civil War to find refuge, by the end up in concentration camps, they are rescued by the Nobel Prize Pablo Neruda.

249
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:48.570
Perla Sasson-Henry: Who commission's a ship the winnipeg and takes all these people to chill it so in this piece as students do more research, they can see the names of all these people who have been joining a virtually.

250
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:58.770
Perla Sasson-Henry: They embark on a list of people write the names of their family members and those names are reflected as they are crossing the ocean.

251
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:13.530
Perla Sasson-Henry: So it highlights the relevance of Pablo Neruda so there's a lot of history literature language and the students, of course, a look at the dynamics of this knowledge base.

252
00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:29.070
Perla Sasson-Henry: And finally, the year was coming to an end, and there were final capstone projects to accomplish so some of them were more they are in than others and Sam, for example, ended up with a joint project.

253
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:43.710
Perla Sasson-Henry: One of them was a tool to expose a information about a lady for a watermelon feminist and activist will disappear in 1982 in the water, my last civil war.

254
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:54.060
Perla Sasson-Henry: So I think that as the years go by a Spanish elite in Spanish, for the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language and culture has a lot of future.

255
00:50:54.570 --> 00:51:13.830
Perla Sasson-Henry: And as more and the anthology the Latin American anthology has come out and also the database from Chile organized by Catalina gangsta is up and running, so we are all delighted to have all these for a elitist bench Thank you very much.

256
00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:19.410
Angela.Celis: Thank.

257
00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:23.340
Angela.Celis: Thank you, I.

258
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:40.230
Angela.Celis: I apologize for the inconvenience, but my wi fi connection has fallen down, so I I don't understand, I cannot understand that anyway, if you want, I can follow with.

259
00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.150
Angela.Celis: my presentation in the point.

260
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.340
Angela.Celis: and

261
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.690
Angela.Celis: i've lost my connection, if you want.

262
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:56.220
Angela.Celis: So.

263
00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.360
Angela.Celis: Well, what I was.

264
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:11.700
Angela.Celis: saying is that, during my teaching in Toledo, I have reflected a about the teaching languages in both oral and written form.

265
00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:23.820
Angela.Celis: And about the hypertext and the way the hypertext has trust for me and level bit our communication, I have concluded that.

266
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:47.670
Angela.Celis: They will teach electronic externalities bad steel with the buttons of analogous to externalities with classical communications scheme, the one One the one that Roman the COPs on the signed in 1960 is blending the uni directional communication in the oral and writing environment.

267
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.580
Angela.Celis: It looks like these.

268
00:52:52.440 --> 00:53:06.240
Angela.Celis: What I what I see is that our students know the scheme but they use also the hyper takes one even more than the other in their daily communication.

269
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:21.990
Angela.Celis: So I designed a new review scheme that I propose in my thesis or dissertation as around three journey among say among sender message and receiver.

270
00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:32.580
Angela.Celis: Let me continue with this quote of Dr Philip our man as a you know.

271
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:55.980
Angela.Celis: He was the creator of penniman a historical technical museum and the research that they develop then in in Panama, there was not only crucial to the cause of Second World War but impacted in the future in this piece travels and satellite links.

272
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:01.950
Angela.Celis: And the way we are all connected right now, even if I.

273
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:13.800
Angela.Celis: I was out for him for a while, he said that the progress and innovation are the key aspect of modern society.

274
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:40.200
Angela.Celis: And we as a society have an influence on what gets research and developed, therefore, we kind of frame that they communicative change, we are facing, has become a matter of research and development, not only in public communicative uses, but also in those defined as artistic like elite.

275
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:54.090
Angela.Celis: teaching in my courses I has taught that the history of humanity is the history of the evolution of technique.

276
00:54:55.740 --> 00:55:07.530
Angela.Celis: I was histories, also the history of teaching and learning the techniques and the technologies to capture and preserve their own story, the whole history.

277
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:21.390
Angela.Celis: Moreover, every period of history has a new technology of writing that has had to be learned, so we have the cave paintings.

278
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:37.890
Angela.Celis: Hoon, a form writing your only fake writing appears scrolling habla books printed books and then ebooks I bought iPad kindle or whatever.

279
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:52.590
Angela.Celis: understanding how these techniques works worked was critical to being among the light only those who had the knowledge, then had the power than.

280
00:55:53.250 --> 00:56:02.070
Angela.Celis: And the same thing is happening in the 21 century with the use of ICT and hypertext well communication.

281
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:23.190
Angela.Celis: Was Antonio median explain that idea when he says, the struggle to understand and use the new digital technologies requires many new things, yes, but is it presupposes the old ones and the most important of these is reading.

282
00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:54.030
Angela.Celis: So that's what I think I mean, I think that we are facing a text will transition, we come from analogous society where communication is linear sequential and sequential, not only in in in reading, but also in writing, and now we are in front is digital society.

283
00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:02.160
Angela.Celis: Where telematics networks and the generalization of the Internet and the Hebrew text to our language.

284
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.050
Angela.Celis: Has.

285
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:09.660
Angela.Celis: This nonlinear non sequential communication.

286
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:16.080
Angela.Celis: i'm i'm i'm trying to be very sort so.

287
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:41.010
Angela.Celis: I think we, we have a kind of contextual sent in front of us with a text and elite it's about hypertext while reading or electronic reading that give us a contextual sense of reading That means that there is a text in.

288
00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:54.660
Angela.Celis: Total polymorphous in or a test as the addition of each and every one of the elements that make up this external appearance.

289
00:57:55.110 --> 00:58:06.030
Angela.Celis: which includes all verbal iconic and auditory forms which are necessary each other to configure its global meaning.

290
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:36.240
Angela.Celis: In the Muslim i'll validate who has constructed and these these term polyamorous is a from poly much numerous and across is hearing action of listening so with the hypertext and elite, we are in front of a multiple listening listener, but I think there is also a multiple emission and.

291
00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:39.270
Angela.Celis: I I tried to.

292
00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:58.740
Angela.Celis: create this term poly homely by analogy with poly across seas were poly is also much numerous and homely is meeting conversation deal company, and I have.

293
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:14.400
Angela.Celis: I want to return with this term, to the in it more logical sense of homey as idea of encounter meeting of Sander including that veto one.

294
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:31.920
Angela.Celis: The new discursive space is likewise a new social space where communications take place without the physical presence of participants, maybe this is a new and new agora or a male our.

295
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:47.400
Angela.Celis: The main characteristic is the immediacy and i'm spontaneity of all these girls, plus the linguistic uses have written this cruise united in this new digital and telling matic space.

296
00:59:48.420 --> 01:00:07.950
Angela.Celis: In this pays the role of sender and receiver has moved forward to that new paradigm, we have seen before, we are facing a new field of writing that multiplies and this person has its dimensions.

297
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:17.370
Angela.Celis: We can say that we are, are we have a new communicative paladin that accepts.

298
01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:29.340
Angela.Celis: The entire communicative process and, as we say, as as as we see our or, as we know, we.

299
01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:31.890
Angela.Celis: Are right now.

300
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:41.940
Angela.Celis: In the third hot ality and faculties externality as Jose Manuela Sophia Lucy and Lucy Emma he has said.

301
01:00:43.050 --> 01:01:06.600
Angela.Celis: them first orality is then on morality, the second is mass media reality and the third is the ICT orality and then the second is 20 is also the ICT so ality and while the first week was that, with the manuscript and printed books, where.

302
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:40.470
Angela.Celis: new digital born later to emerge and respond to that new part of that by adding we have new referential canon that forces us to know the new reading paths, but research on elite is done using text in the first test quality that mean that that is manuscript or printed at least mostly.

303
01:01:42.030 --> 01:02:03.690
Angela.Celis: Reading digital works continues to become paradoxically, and in most cases in plain sequential text we teach third orality and second externality with the traditional methods of this second orality and first text reality.

304
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:29.160
Angela.Celis: How students can read as a pollyanna classes pan text, while is structure, but they use the poly homely just for personal communication, especially in social networks by but they don't use it for creating their own he text, at least in my cosies.

305
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:44.580
Angela.Celis: I can show you some examples I asked them to research about narrative value into digital narrative or elite and they do such.

306
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:46.680
Angela.Celis: works.

307
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:55.650
Angela.Celis: You can see our domain to suspect that it was a steady goes from few analyse Lou the course that means first.

308
01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:06.780
Angela.Celis: or second first orality and second externality you know and also when they talk about video whales.

309
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:22.170
Angela.Celis: They say that it bothers me the awareness as important as well for medical and veterinary story, and so on, but is always writing they don't create in this third and orality and say context to quality.

310
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.960
Angela.Celis: Even when they talk about high perfection.

311
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:34.230
Angela.Celis: exploitative or constructive So to conclude.

312
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:43.590
Angela.Celis: Non stem students can read a text, while instructor alia classes.

313
01:03:44.700 --> 01:04:00.180
Angela.Celis: But polly AMI homely is used for personnel communication, not for creating their own eat text so they know that technology as readers not as writers.

314
01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:13.230
Angela.Celis: I think we are facing a new technology and new communication and communication paradigm, however, very few users are familiar with the coding technique.

315
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:33.960
Angela.Celis: Of these new communications, so I X myself and I X, you are our students digital natives as friends key says in 2001 or simply digital consumers.

316
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:40.710
Angela.Celis: Are they digital residents as why to look on Lake or me.

317
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:51.300
Angela.Celis: said in 2011 or are they therefore digital literacy literacy.

318
01:04:52.830 --> 01:05:05.070
Angela.Celis: And then, should we consider digital literacy, to those who are just receivers but not producers.

319
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.870
Angela.Celis: Thank you very much and I apologize again for the.

320
01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.510
Angela.Celis: For my presentation before Thank you.

321
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:48.180
Perla Sasson-Henry: Welcome, thank you, thank you Angela and thank you, everybody for being so patient during our little things here and there, but a we have very few minutes a for a tour questions, if you would like to to raise some questions comments.

322
01:05:55.230 --> 01:06:11.100
Perla Sasson-Henry: And whether you are thinking about some of the questions I don't want to miss this opportunity to thank the organizers of this international 24 hour going on conference and we we really appreciate this opportunity okay Thank you so much.

323
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.390
Perla Sasson-Henry: Yes, rob kilo.

324
01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:28.770
Rob Wittig: Wonderful presentations all of them, and I just wanted to just follow up on the excellent point that Angela made in her conclusion about this.

325
01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:48.900
Rob Wittig: compartmentalization or partition that I see in my students minds as well, between all this incredible creative writing they do every day and literature, with a capital L and and you know can thinking of it like that, and.

326
01:06:50.700 --> 01:07:04.680
Rob Wittig: i'm i've been experimenting with ways to kind of bridge that gap, but it's, it is a really interesting problem and and it's it's just interesting to me to see.

327
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:18.330
Rob Wittig: I I try strategies like talking about the origins of the English novel and how shaky they were and how nobody really knew if it was fiction or not, or you know what and saying we're in a period like that.

328
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:32.220
Rob Wittig: And sometimes that goes through that that sinks in, but what strategies are you using to kind of bridge that gap and say, yes, this informal writing activity can become literature.

329
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:43.140
Rob Wittig: Or you for it yeah for for all the panelists to.

330
01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:54.090
Perla Sasson-Henry: I think it came, it was very it was very interesting to me Wendy English major, who was the Spanish minor decided to do the Twitter at European.

331
01:07:54.660 --> 01:08:00.180
Perla Sasson-Henry: He said Oh, this is another way that I can express myself His story was about.

332
01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:06.480
Perla Sasson-Henry: going from Mexico to the United States and get stranded in Mexico.

333
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:23.850
Perla Sasson-Henry: And if he didn't know about these possibilities of being besides his paper journal know to to express his creative writing, probably, and this was a new means for him to do that, so I think that was very interesting to for him to discover, and for me to see he was.

334
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:31.920
Perla Sasson-Henry: Maybe in the fleet in the submarine or whatever he is now I don't know his whatever he's doing and communicating.

335
01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:43.080
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: For me, it was easier to to do that with my teenagers talent in the high school because when.

336
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:46.530
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: The point was that.

337
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:54.300
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: They they don't think that that is Lisa when they go into the.

338
01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:06.900
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: into the Facebook or Twitter and when I take them to the Twitter to Twitter to to speak, or to write about.

339
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:31.440
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: The additional lita they feel very short but, at the at the end they like it very much with teachers, it was very hard, because they saw a show a when I began in 2015 a very few technology was into my region schools.

340
01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:42.150
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: And besides of that m day sorry that is our social discourse and telling all the time that.

341
01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:46.890
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: social media is very arm for lamb very.

342
01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:54.180
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Nice very difficult for the teachers to be there with their students and.

343
01:09:55.770 --> 01:10:03.510
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: It was hard during the I think they 10 or 15 first hour so for my cords.

344
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:13.170
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: Allowing the teachers to believe that they litter is on the Internet to.

345
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.060
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: and

346
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:24.780
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: that there has been, not an education about that a case.

347
01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:39.540
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: If you have a many tools, a teachers can do a cat food or I don't know a scratch, but no worries on new monastic point of view.

348
01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:56.490
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: And a own screen tsunami has come out grass and we were not prepared for that and now most of the teachers or of that I know on some colleagues.

349
01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.690
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: In the teacher training Center.

350
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:06.840
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: They look all though these artifacts some.

351
01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.640
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: tools.

352
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:12.690
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: And lita is not only a tool.

353
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.350
Angela.Celis: But I think that that.

354
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:24.600
Angela.Celis: i'm agree with you, but I think, also, the problem is our I mean.

355
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:42.390
Angela.Celis: Of them the teachers, the professor, because sometimes we showed that tools as a game and they don't understand that they are creating but just plain.

356
01:11:42.960 --> 01:12:07.410
Angela.Celis: and also in in in in their homes, I mean when and students arrive at home and play with the computer on the mobile forum, something the parents think that they are just plain, so you have to study you don't have to play, I mean.

357
01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:16.080
Angela.Celis: We have to change our mind with that generation, I think, because they are.

358
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:27.180
Angela.Celis: prepared to create in that and or with this parenting, I think, but maybe we don't.

359
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:34.260
Angela.Celis: Let them to think about this parenting as.

360
01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:40.560
Angela.Celis: A new paradigm, a new padding to to create it I don't I don't know if I.

361
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:51.360
Angela.Celis: If I show you my my idea correctly, but sometimes is our problem, not only their problem.

362
01:12:52.500 --> 01:13:09.900
Angela.Celis: If they don't understand literature or eat as real literature is something that I hear from my students, but this is literature really tutor at the first time and a video game can be.

363
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.140
Angela.Celis: A real creation or.

364
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:23.610
Angela.Celis: Because there's not a cannon I mean we have a Jihadi, for instance, and we can analyze.

365
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.520
Angela.Celis: That novel but there's not a cannon this.

366
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.920
Angela.Celis: They they don't.

367
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:40.830
Angela.Celis: study the literature in the high school like they study literature.

368
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.190
Angela.Celis: In the first or second.

369
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.140
Angela.Celis: and

370
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:49.890
Angela.Celis: I don't know.

371
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:51.840
Angela.Celis: So maybe.

372
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.820
Angela.Celis: Maria.

373
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.440
Mar?a Goicoechea: Hello.

374
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.110
Mar?a Goicoechea: To say hello.

375
01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:09.120
Mar?a Goicoechea: And I want to thank you for presentations they were very inspiring and i'm going to introduce some of your works and ideas in my course.

376
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:17.520
Mar?a Goicoechea: And I wanted to add that today that's why I looked in a bit later at 230 I finished my class and today it was the students.

377
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:32.550
Mar?a Goicoechea: Presentation they had to show their projects, so I think we are actually acting as bridges between the old paradigm, and the new paradigm, and, as you said it, I totally agree with you it's also our responsibility.

378
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:41.100
Mar?a Goicoechea: In this course, today I was fascinated because they completely outdated my expectations, I gave them ideas suggestions.

379
01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:56.460
Mar?a Goicoechea: I showed them programs, but I have to confess, they did things I don't even understand I don't know how they manage, and this is students that they confess didn't know how to code, but they have their resources, so they they.

380
01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:07.860
Mar?a Goicoechea: Try to engage all the people from their surroundings, to help them with their piece oh you're a native speaker of English so you're going to record the audio for this story.

381
01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:17.850
Mar?a Goicoechea: Or you know how to program help me with this and I today, we were you know summarizing and I told them, you see, this is part of the process, this is.

382
01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:31.800
Mar?a Goicoechea: You know, an interdisciplinary feel you see you need to ask for help and all the problems you have overcome you know, like trying to well I couldn't integrate trying in this in wordpress but I did it this way.

383
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:45.720
Mar?a Goicoechea: Well, this is part of you know, our everyday circumstances if you're a creator and you don't have all the skills, you know so well, I want to throw a bit of optimism, because I was.

384
01:15:46.170 --> 01:16:04.050
Mar?a Goicoechea: You know, really surprised happily surprised, and I think they felt proud and that's something that you know I think the teachers are also offering them do something confront a challenge, and when you overcome you know those problems you feel so powerful.

385
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:19.170
Mar?a Goicoechea: That, I think you know for them also he was an interesting experience, so I think we're all part of this now in every little feel we're trying to steal this passion and.

386
01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:20.490
Mar?a Goicoechea: So.

387
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.980
Scott Rettberg: we're just gonna make a comment on something Angeles said.

388
01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:36.330
Scott Rettberg: In terms of the the interact the reaction of students like that this is not literature this can't be literature it's interesting for me, because you know.

389
01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:44.940
Scott Rettberg: 20 years ago or not 2018 I guess a long time ago, when I first started teaching electronic literature in New Jersey.

390
01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:51.990
Scott Rettberg: And I would often get that reaction from students that you know how do I, how do I read this I don't see this as literature.

391
01:16:52.350 --> 01:17:00.990
Scott Rettberg: Whereas now, I think the stronger the more difficult poll it's not it's not so much like they jump in and they can figure out interfaces very quickly and.

392
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:08.730
Scott Rettberg: there's not that sort of blockage but the the the bigger challenge as well, how do you what is this, you know what is this literature.

393
01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:20.730
Scott Rettberg: What is this reading, you know what is this, I think it's more the sort of flipped more to the other direction yeah exactly or mark says what does it mean to interpret.

394
01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:33.750
Scott Rettberg: So, in a way that's sort of a positive and negative and then the other comment, I was going to make just following up on what Maria was saying is one of the thing one of the things that has struck me about.

395
01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:54.810
Scott Rettberg: about the presentations here is how many there's a lot of quite a few young people who are presenting video, for the first time, and not only that, but who who say, you know that it came out of their class and like when we were interviewing below Muhammad.

396
01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:07.830
Scott Rettberg: One of the authors that we interviewed for the COPA de lis documentary it was really striking when he said, you know I first started working on this coven project for my he lit class.

397
01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:27.810
Scott Rettberg: You know and it's it's just i've been surprised at how many and pleasantly surprised at how many of the people here actually took a class on electronic literature and often in places where I didn't even know that they were teaching it so so i'm really encouraged yeah.

398
01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:36.450
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: I optimist, I am optimistic too and i'm my details were very, very engaged it and I was.

399
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:56.130
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: worried because I didn't have more time to to tell them Okay, we will go ahead with the tools we we know we have we know how to use, and now we all are doing electronic poem.

400
01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.200
Oreto Dom?nech i Masi?: So that's a summit to concur.

401
01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:10.380
Perla Sasson-Henry: I think I would like to thank again everybody I know we run almost out of time, and such a nice conversation we are having.

402
01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:27.330
Perla Sasson-Henry: Maybe we can continue it in one of the discourse salons and could be nice to continue this so, but the administration administrator has his or her hands raised there, so I think I think it's telling us to move to the other track probably.

403
01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.070
Perla Sasson-Henry: So.

404
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.170
Perla Sasson-Henry: I don't know if that so Scott, when the administrator races his or her hand.

405
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:38.460
Perla Sasson-Henry: We have to close the room is telling me yes.

406
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:42.150
Perla Sasson-Henry: Okay Scott you're on mute.

407
01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:49.470
Scott Rettberg: Sorry yeah that that's that's quite likely what administrator mass person is say.

408
01:19:50.070 --> 01:20:00.840
Perla Sasson-Henry: Okay, well, thank you to all and i'm sure that a we would also inspired by by your comments to move forward and to continue to spread the love of elite.

409
01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:08.400
Perla Sasson-Henry: To the world know it to the skies and to the cce Okay, thank you very much okay okay.
