00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:19.350
Jack Murray: All right, Hello everyone, welcome to the virtualized material games panel i'm jack Murray and joining me our toe from rafi and Nick loan to begin i'd like to give an overview and hopefully preempt some of the questions that.

2
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:31.500
Jack Murray: In reference to the title of the panel, so we chose to use the term material games which we you know don't intend to.

3
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:44.160
Jack Murray: ignore the material histories of electronic literature and technology platforms youth and development consumption of digital media, rather it is intended to highlight specific modes of play that are afforded by the material components of each medium.

4
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.970
Jack Murray: And we're interested in not only the material objects that surround these Games, but also everything that makes up the myriad of microcosms related to technologies of play.

5
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.840
Jack Murray: So while this panel is primarily interested in things related to analog games, the term analog.

6
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:13.770
Jack Murray: is often taken to me non digital, though, as the editors of the analog game studies journal note, there is a hybrid of the inherent in analog games in the current technological era, the design.

7
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.760
Jack Murray: Development and presentation and play of analog games often incorporate a variety of digital elements such.

8
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.610
Jack Murray: As such, we use the term virtual to evoke multiple meetings virtual as a way of being.

9
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.230
Jack Murray: through the use of computer systems as in virtual reality and virtual as in something that contains a vast potential for connections and forums.

10
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.170
Jack Murray: And lastly, our discussion will primarily cover variety of games, we believe, while are.

11
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.450
Jack Murray: We still believe that this intersection between games and electronic literature is incredibly broad.

12
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.610
Jack Murray: And this is increasingly apparent in the rising popularity of narrative driven games that take cues from interactive fiction or use digital tools to facilitate storytelling.

13
00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.800
Jack Murray: The specific games and media we've discussed might not be explicitly related, however, our purpose in addressing them here is to think through the ways technology is impacting.

14
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.320
Jack Murray: play and as well as discuss a variety of tools that can be used to unpack this relationship in short virtualized material games.

15
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:20.310
Jack Murray: highlights the material assemblages of play and offers ways to think through the relationships between analog and digital platforms so without further ado, I will pass the MIC over to toe for who will.

16
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.170
Jack Murray: lead us off.

17
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.070
Topher Maraffi: Okay, thanks jack so let me go ahead and share my screen.

18
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.080
Topher Maraffi: and, hopefully, you can.

19
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.430
Topher Maraffi: see that Okay, am I coming through all right.

20
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.100
Topher Maraffi: Okay, great.

21
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.720
Topher Maraffi: So i'm gonna i'm gonna start off.

22
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.580
Topher Maraffi: My title of my my presentation is X our narrative and performative play to enhance competitive board games that X.

23
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.160
Topher Maraffi: So I think it's kind of a not not a great title but.

24
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.660
Topher Maraffi: But.

25
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.310
Topher Maraffi: i'll try to elaborate on that a bit.

26
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.120
Topher Maraffi: So, the main thing is that.

27
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:26.220
Topher Maraffi: I teach in MFA program on inner entertainment media and technology and we're focusing a lot on.

28
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.810
Topher Maraffi: xr emerging technologies and interfaces as well as game design and.

29
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.250
Topher Maraffi: we're exploring player aesthetics.

30
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.470
Topher Maraffi: In several projects where we take material play experiences like board games and escape rooms and.

31
00:03:47.790 --> 00:04:00.480
Topher Maraffi: are transforming those two virtual spaces in xlr and so some questions that come up in, that is, how does virtual scale and changing perspective in xr worlds affect the player experience.

32
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:24.840
Topher Maraffi: In this presentation i'm going to argue that the first person play and xr space is becoming more embodied in performative, especially in vr and we can therefore draw from theatre arts to enhance gameplay and narrative aesthetics in these experiences and so.

33
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.820
Topher Maraffi: The.

34
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:43.740
Topher Maraffi: A good example of that is the wizard chess in Harry Potter and how the scale in that becomes very performative when its life size or larger than life.

35
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:59.640
Topher Maraffi: And so the player actually becomes more of a performer or object on the chessboard, and is not separate from the board directing it from above or outside.

36
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:12.480
Topher Maraffi: The game rules may be the same for the game itself, but the perspective and change is much more dramatic and performative when it's that scale.

37
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.550
Topher Maraffi: And immersing your your player in it.

38
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.830
Topher Maraffi: So some of the issues or.

39
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:45.810
Topher Maraffi: Concepts design concepts that impact this research are dealing with the nba framework which we use for game design it's a very popular framework from the early 2000s and the lewd ology versus narrative ology debate of the same period.

40
00:05:47.520 --> 00:06:04.050
Topher Maraffi: are something that I i'm trying to address with with this performative aspect, the question of where where is that in these game design frameworks, the nba is being criticized for not really having a good.

41
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:24.930
Topher Maraffi: way to address narrative and you know it came out at a time when there was this debate, and most of the ones who came up with mda were on the side, so they took a very much approach from from that framework.

42
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.720
Topher Maraffi: But.

43
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.260
Topher Maraffi: i'm also looking at how can we.

44
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:39.180
Topher Maraffi: bring these two sides together through performance and also how to alleviate ludo narrative dissonance.

45
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:50.400
Topher Maraffi: Something that hawking talked about that you know a good example is when you're running around in assassin's creed and you come on some camp in the middle of the.

46
00:06:50.760 --> 00:07:02.910
Topher Maraffi: woods and the game incentivizes you to kill everybody in the camp and loot their treasure, even though they're not your enemies you don't know them at all and you're supposed to be a hero.

47
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:12.240
Topher Maraffi: There have been many times in that game where i've been running around and i've like been torn by this decision of whether I should actually.

48
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:29.190
Topher Maraffi: You know attack this village, so that kind of thing, where the the narrative and the the way you're playing as a hero, for instance doesn't line up with with the gameplay with the games and giving you to do.

49
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:42.870
Topher Maraffi: And, and also things like we're looking at board games and how clue and D amp D have very performative features in them, especially the live action role play in D amp D.

50
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.860
Topher Maraffi: Something that you know I did back in the day.

51
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.660
Topher Maraffi: In the 80s and and I, I think that.

52
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.370
Topher Maraffi: You know that's not really addressed with these either.

53
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.350
Topher Maraffi: So.

54
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:06.540
Topher Maraffi: I think that that we're looking at xr and especially a lot of our projects use vr and.

55
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:24.390
Topher Maraffi: Looking at the best or the most immersive vr experiences in games out there really show their part of Jenkins convergence culture where it's bringing you know film and and games and all these different and actually.

56
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.000
Topher Maraffi: literature all together.

57
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:44.820
Topher Maraffi: into these trans transmedia story worlds and and things like the avoids vr theater Star Wars experience, because of the empire and vader immortal when you're playing them feel very theatrical.

58
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.220
Topher Maraffi: You know you're playing with this life size or larger than life.

59
00:08:51.630 --> 00:09:04.620
Topher Maraffi: And PCs of darth vader and they're standing in front of you, and you can see all the details and in the case of the voice theaters they actually put in performative principles from magic theatre because.

60
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:21.420
Topher Maraffi: The the one of the founders was a magician and and and and so that you're actually getting smells and and you're able to walk in an unlimited way, even though you're in a limited space and really try to engage all those senses.

61
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:28.950
Topher Maraffi: To create the illusion of this almost theatrical experience and so.

62
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:46.800
Topher Maraffi: When i'm talking about performative you know, this being an elo conference and talking about narrative a lot of times, this will be put under the narrative and and what i'm really talking about is is not what's from the script.

63
00:09:47.820 --> 00:10:07.140
Topher Maraffi: If you are an actor, you get a script there are certain things specified in the script and there's certain things that you as an actor improvise and so things in the game that are not specified by the script or the gameplay but which the player gets to choose and.

64
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:20.280
Topher Maraffi: You know, is based really on their style of play, and so you know when I play shooter games, I prefer to stay back and or games that have.

65
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:35.790
Topher Maraffi: some kind of fighting in them, I usually prefer to stay back and sniper as opposed to running forward into the fray and and that's a style of aspect of performative play and things like you know.

66
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:46.290
Topher Maraffi: Changing your characters appearance and the skills that you choose all of those things are performative aspects of character play.

67
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:53.280
Topher Maraffi: Other concepts that that are going into this.

68
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.890
Topher Maraffi: Research are really.

69
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:12.000
Topher Maraffi: Using this magic circle as world building activities is and the sort of loser loser attitude is very similar to the suspension of disbelief in theater.

70
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:18.930
Topher Maraffi: Edward Gordon craig's performative concept of the uber marionette as the perfect actor.

71
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:29.280
Topher Maraffi: That doesn't have any sort of never goes out of character and doesn't have any of the actors ego in it.

72
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:43.410
Topher Maraffi: He came up with that concept in 1907 and and described it, and a for the theater of the future, and he said what the wires will be I don't know and he kept trying to create it.

73
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:58.080
Topher Maraffi: Up until he died, but was never able to technologically make it, but I argue that that's that is digital characters in games and and and the wires, for that is Ai code.

74
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:18.720
Topher Maraffi: And so being this little narrative dissonance through bridging new dodgy and narrow technology with this performance psychology approach so that your your character acting from the script is connecting to the gameplay all of that sort of aligning.

75
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:29.940
Topher Maraffi: and looking at kicks me highs flow concepts and other concepts of immersive immersion in theater.

76
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:45.690
Topher Maraffi: it's flow has been applied to both theatrical acting and video game play and the flow Arc has been compared to the narrative Arc and so sort of trying to come up with a framework that will align these things.

77
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.680
Topher Maraffi: is something that we're applying.

78
00:12:51.570 --> 00:13:01.680
Topher Maraffi: In this research, and I call it the sugar play framework it's got three aspects screenplay gameplay and role play, and those are really the narrative.

79
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:18.600
Topher Maraffi: ludic and performative aspects of play i'm really trying to sort of break these down into separate areas that can be covered in a game analysis and game design and.

80
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:28.290
Topher Maraffi: Then, since this is an elo conference i'll you know i'm very interested in sort of literary aesthetics and and sort of.

81
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:39.180
Topher Maraffi: Something like Alan wake, which I thought did a really good job as a game of creating of the seal and the aesthetics, of the Stephen King novel.

82
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:46.140
Topher Maraffi: That align the gameplay and the themes of light and dark and fight or flight with.

83
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.600
Topher Maraffi: With the.

84
00:13:49.980 --> 00:14:08.430
Topher Maraffi: narrative as well as with the performative aspect of the character is a writer, which is very common in a lot of the Stephen King novels and other kind of literary aspects like narration and actually turning words into objects, in some parts of the game.

85
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:26.370
Topher Maraffi: So you know, looking at all three of these areas of play in games and taking this framework and really trying to formalize it has been something that i've been doing in my game studies and game design courses.

86
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:40.620
Topher Maraffi: So that I give my students qualitative survey with questions for each area and and then they calculate that in plotted on this chart.

87
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.080
Topher Maraffi: to chart playfulness or a balance of the three areas of play, which is actually in the Center of the chart.

88
00:14:50.850 --> 00:15:08.820
Topher Maraffi: And usually older Games will fall out towards the edges of the chart because they don't really have much of the three aspects or towards one area, the other but, but a lot of these Cinematic games are falling in the middle area of the chart.

89
00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:24.930
Topher Maraffi: So, going back to the some of the projects that we're doing in our MFA to sort of bring some aspects of board game play into this vr space in this xr space, one of them is.

90
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:36.120
Topher Maraffi: This game which which focuses on Indian culture it's it's.

91
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:51.180
Topher Maraffi: Basically, takes Indian board games that things like ludo that you're tossing dice and and you're moving through parts of the Board and.

92
00:15:52.680 --> 00:16:03.030
Topher Maraffi: Malaysia brought this out and made it lifesize so that you're you're you've got a full size board and an environment that.

93
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:15.300
Topher Maraffi: surrounds you and has aspects, especially in story mode of the mahabharata and bringing those narrative aspects in three different cards that come up in the environment.

94
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:24.570
Topher Maraffi: As you're rolling your dice and and then the performative aspects in some of the character designs and characters that you're using.

95
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:47.190
Topher Maraffi: Based on the pen of us and core of us of the mahabharata and the major scene, that is, at the Center of that epic, which is the dice game between those two families that actually gets the the Panda was exiled and then leads to the climax of the war.

96
00:16:48.900 --> 00:17:01.140
Topher Maraffi: So those sort of narrative aspects are bringing in there, as well as performative aspects in some of the design of this project, and I have a link here that I can I can.

97
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:15.690
Topher Maraffi: get this PDF of my slides to anybody who wants to click on the link, so you can go to my my website toe from rafi COM to see some examples of prototypes there.

98
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.930
Topher Maraffi: This one murder mystery theater.

99
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:38.040
Topher Maraffi: Actually it's a magic leap project where we're taking aspects of clue and murder mystery improv theater productions and using the magically headset and also we're doing some stuff in vr as well as sort of.

100
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:56.310
Topher Maraffi: Trying to deliver lines to a player and place life size bodies and environment with blood splatter that you can follow with a UV light which controller is actually a UV light and placed in the environment.

101
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:09.690
Topher Maraffi: So that you're actually moving through your environment and finding clues and delivery lines and also try to produce some kind of mass theater type of thing.

102
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:22.020
Topher Maraffi: we're also doing something related to this with IBM Watson where I can recognize your lines, so that it can check your lines against lines for the character.

103
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:38.280
Topher Maraffi: To make sort of an actor training type of tools to get this performative aspect into this space, this sort of full size space and we have other projects that we're working on for vr.

104
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:53.010
Topher Maraffi: That to have to do with D amp D and lark in a construction set and also a vr escape room in Egyptian pyramid that uses.

105
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:54.750
Topher Maraffi: sort of.

106
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.650
Topher Maraffi: educates on Egyptian culture and Egyptian gods so.

107
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:21.240
Topher Maraffi: that's that's basically what I wanted to talk about today i'm not sure where I am on time, but those are some of the projects, there were that we're working on that are trying to bring these three aspects of the narrative performative and.

108
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:28.320
Topher Maraffi: Competitive gameplay sort of consciously together with this this framework.

109
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.580
Topher Maraffi: And you know I.

110
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.310
Topher Maraffi: This.

111
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:52.650
Topher Maraffi: presentation was not originally for her for an electronic literature venue so so I apologize if that did not have as much electronic literature content as you guys are used to.

112
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.180
Jack Murray: Great.

113
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.240
Jack Murray: So next we'll have Nick present.

114
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.090
Nick LaLone: Oh, goodness.

115
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.300
Nick LaLone: Well, let me get myself situated.

116
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.030
Nick LaLone: I was just grabbing something um.

117
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.830
Nick LaLone: So I wanted to give.

118
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:41.490
Nick LaLone: A link to my slide deck and to usually, when i'm on a panel or i'm about to present a paper or something like that i'll write a post on up some blog platform about it, and so there are the links to those two things now let me grab my.

119
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.670
Nick LaLone: thing here.

120
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.290
Nick LaLone: Also, thank you tow for.

121
00:20:50.700 --> 00:21:02.940
Nick LaLone: i'm tragically I can never use a vr goggles ever the second I do I barf so that is not something for me.

122
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.910
So let's go with this one.

123
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.530
Nick LaLone: All right.

124
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.840
Nick LaLone: where's my.

125
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:32.130
Nick LaLone: need the G force experience alright, so my name is Nicole alone, I am a an assistant Professor over at the University of nebraska at omaha I am in the MIT s department which is management information systems, but my training is in sociology, particularly in pop culture sociology.

126
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:48.300
Nick LaLone: A lot of what i'm going to be talking about today, has to do with the tensions of who I was as a sociologist and who, I am now as somebody who's in an MIT s department, but my training is in human computer interaction computer science things like that.

127
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.700
Jack Murray: Nick we're seeing the presenter notes.

128
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:54.810
Nick LaLone: No.

129
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:55.740
Jack Murray: All right.

130
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.200
Nick LaLone: Are you still seeing them yes.

131
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.020
Nick LaLone: I picked the wrong or day.

132
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.680
Jack Murray: Nothing.

133
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:02.430
Okay, good.

134
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:04.860
Nick LaLone: So.

135
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:15.510
Nick LaLone: The sort of talk that I wanted to put together, has to do with the tension between my past self and my current self and my wife tells me that the sound I often make is.

136
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:29.280
Nick LaLone: So I gave this sound as many different m words as I could string together that made sense in this case we're going to be talking a little bit about makers being miffed about the things that they've created.

137
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:39.390
Nick LaLone: they're being used in appropriately they've been appropriated for other reasons methods are often misused when evaluating especially digital objects.

138
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:53.670
Nick LaLone: And this is often do to kind of the history of where those methods originally came from, because we often misused methods to understand what we're seeing a lot of measures, end up getting mast.

139
00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:02.490
Nick LaLone: A lot of the consequences of how particular products are created or how specific materiality is this, in this case board games.

140
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:11.790
Nick LaLone: are getting messed either by computation they're getting masked by contexts that we can't access there's just a lot of stuff we can't get to.

141
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:30.000
Nick LaLone: And I believe that the the sort of reason for this is that we often afford different modalities different levels of we can basically just access them in different ways computation lends itself computer mediated spaces lend themselves to being understood.

142
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:41.460
Nick LaLone: Mostly, because we have access to every single action in terms of keystrokes and we can look at chat we can look at inputs and things like that.

143
00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:49.740
Nick LaLone: And finally, this moment it's mapped i'm going to be talking about a little bit later, so this first aspect makers miffed a lot of my work.

144
00:23:50.700 --> 00:24:04.440
Nick LaLone: goes into disaster um the disaster world emergency management, they rely on role playing and they rely on tabletop exercises to understand the world that they're about to inhabit.

145
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:10.830
Nick LaLone: And the world that they're about to inhabit is typically things that are completely destroyed there's no electricity.

146
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:21.900
Nick LaLone: there's no connectivity and so they have often felt that they don't necessarily need fancy computational models about how disasters work.

147
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:33.120
Nick LaLone: But unfortunately what ends up happening is that because emergency management doesn't know or understand how computation can affect their tabletop exercises.

148
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:44.220
Nick LaLone: different things occur, so a lot of my early work as a Grad student had to do with the Boston marathon bombing and just as a kind of what it what happened with this is um.

149
00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:55.830
Nick LaLone: read it had been trying to shift what they did from sort of aggregating links aggregating information and talking about it to aggregating in real time.

150
00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:04.620
Nick LaLone: And what ends up happening with the Boston marathon bombing the FBI route was reliant on the tip line.

151
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:13.350
Nick LaLone: And in this case the tip line was if you have any video if you have any audio please send it to us, we need to try and figure out who.

152
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:23.850
Nick LaLone: placed these pressure cooker bombs right at the finish line of the Boston marathon bombing and what ends up happening here is several petabytes of data suddenly appear and the FBI has no way.

153
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:37.770
Nick LaLone: To go through this, they have no they're not prepared to deal with this much information, and so the crowd tries to go around and figure out who the Boston marathon bombers were and they end up failing horribly.

154
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:51.090
Nick LaLone: And so what ends up happening and what this ends up pointing to is that no tabletop exercise no analog game could prepare them for this sort of mediated space this this this.

155
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:57.660
Nick LaLone: Multiple reality xr a or whatever you want to call it, and it reflects.

156
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:11.760
Nick LaLone: To differing ways of thinking about the world so for the tabletop folks they want to get embedded into their roles very quickly versus computer software designers who are.

157
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:18.510
Nick LaLone: Creating an artifact that contains pathak possibilities that allows them perform particular tasks and has particular requirements.

158
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:28.980
Nick LaLone: This is the task artifact cycle, we constantly cycle through, because when we released an artifact to the wild people use it in ways we weren't anticipating and what ends up happening is we sit there.

159
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:41.280
Nick LaLone: And our spent we spend all of our time pat patching we spend all of our time trying to make sense of how users are misusing or using in ways that we didn't anticipate.

160
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:47.610
Nick LaLone: And a lot of this has to do with you know the diversity of the development team, the talent of the development team.

161
00:26:48.210 --> 00:27:01.170
Nick LaLone: And so what ends up happening is we're left with this complete disagreement about how the computerized world how the computer mediated world should represent.

162
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:14.430
Nick LaLone: These this sort of analog or physical space and when we try to study it what ends up happening is we evaluate it from the perspective of either.

163
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.350
Nick LaLone: People are doing this thing or software is creating this problem.

164
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:32.790
Nick LaLone: And as a person who began in sociology and ended up in the technical spaces, I have been obsessing over ways to evaluate how people the materials that they need and the materials that they use.

165
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:48.180
Nick LaLone: Software the creators, where this particular space ends up because if you look at how we evaluate us how we evaluate play how we evaluate games, we use a lot of things to.

166
00:27:50.040 --> 00:28:03.360
Nick LaLone: sort of see if you know it's just a little acceptable if it's just another level of complexity, on top of our growing complexity complex lives, and I think the best way to illustrate this has to do with Robinson Crusoe.

167
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:13.770
Nick LaLone: In this case we have Robinson Crusoe and Friday or the other island so Crusoe is this is sort of the birth of realistic fiction.

168
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.230
Nick LaLone: Crusoe is sort of the birth of the modern man he goes to the wilds and he colonizes it.

169
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:26.850
Nick LaLone: By replicating the world that he came from it, so he just starts adding all of these different things he's able to fish he's growing food.

170
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:43.620
Nick LaLone: he's got gunpowder and weapons and he's got this education his guy Friday who's a savage he trains him and they all go back eventually to England and live their modern man lives versus Friday or the other island, which is a sad satirical retelling of this.

171
00:28:45.390 --> 00:29:01.980
Nick LaLone: Everything Crusoe does adds tension and pressure to the world that they're living in to the world that he's trying to recreate and over time for Crusoe is so in love with what he's doing he literally tries to have sex with the island.

172
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.420
Nick LaLone: And what ends up happening at the end of Friday, or the other island is Friday blows everything up and Crusoe is so relieved that he disappears into the jungle, never to be seen again.

173
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:30.000
Nick LaLone: And this is sort of where we're at when we evaluate with the methods that exist we're not necessarily looking at whether or not the game is necessarily good right we're not looking at this particular thing we're looking at do users accepted or.

174
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:45.660
Nick LaLone: Is it adding something to our survivability is adding something to the island that we've created called video games, or is it something that are we starting to fall a little bit too in love with the way that we're creating and translating play.

175
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.980
Nick LaLone: And a lot of these methods end up.

176
00:29:52.650 --> 00:30:04.950
Nick LaLone: On one one way or the other, although we often try to avoid thinking about us being in love with these digital environments these digital elements that we've been using and.

177
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.900
Nick LaLone: So I keep coming back to this, I keep coming back to this.

178
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:20.970
Nick LaLone: Are we, too, in love with the digital spaces and we just need to constantly sing to blow everything up and start over again, or do we need to keep looking for the space of least disagreement with our methods.

179
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:27.060
Nick LaLone: what's left over what's getting masked in terms of what we're measuring and so I keep.

180
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:38.340
Nick LaLone: One of the things that I have also been trying to figure out is, how can I, while you're watching people mess around with.

181
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:47.070
Nick LaLone: little bits in a game so measles or dice or if we're talking about keyboards and mice or if we're talking about.

182
00:30:48.060 --> 00:31:00.810
Nick LaLone: Is there a way that I can blow up right play is there a way that I can see how every piece that I can see in front of me all the ingredients to the game all the rules to the game.

183
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:14.820
Nick LaLone: It can I look at how each of these is affecting the whole, is there a way that I can gather enough data to understand how an analog version of something works, so that I can translate it into a digital space and work with it.

184
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:25.410
Nick LaLone: And what do I mean by this so social network analysis which is sort of where i've ended up tends to look at humans interacting with other humans.

185
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:37.560
Nick LaLone: And if we're talking about a group of people playing a board game, then we're going to be talking about those people social network analysis allows us to see the sort of interactivity between all the people.

186
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:49.170
Nick LaLone: At the game, but this is where we often misuse method social network analysis relies on this idea that only humans are capable of association of agency.

187
00:31:49.560 --> 00:32:03.090
Nick LaLone: But in order for us to achieve agency as as humans, we have all of these sort of durable pieces of culture that allow us to pursue agency, we can't pursue agency, without them, and so, when we're talking about a board game, we have the.

188
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:11.760
Nick LaLone: Players hands, we have our in the case of Bhutan, we have these different resource cards, we have all the bits on the board.

189
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:23.880
Nick LaLone: each player has particular bits on the board, there are cards that people can use have different powers there's the dice themselves and each of the players each of the player hands.

190
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:33.870
Nick LaLone: We get into the table itself we get into the different parts of the board the reference cards and also the players, so if I take.

191
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:46.500
Nick LaLone: Everything that exists on on a particular board, can I understand play and essentially allow play to form my understanding of what's happening there.

192
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:57.690
Nick LaLone: And in doing that, can I take the different modalities that exists, so if we're talking about analog play which I absolutely hate that term but i'm going to use it, because I have to.

193
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.920
Nick LaLone: versus virtual player digital play um.

194
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:15.570
Nick LaLone: Can I get past this world that wants to reward folks for you making video games versus sort of taking board games and sort of shoving them off onto the side.

195
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:27.750
Nick LaLone: Is there a way for me to not keep misunderstanding modality, but to allow us to understand how modalities shift the way that play for forms within the magic circle itself.

196
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:34.890
Nick LaLone: So I did this for my dissertation This is something I keep coming back to because i'm sort of at that point where i'm like well now what.

197
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:48.360
Nick LaLone: And so, when I looked at was how did patterns change if I watch people play a game of katana and then watch people you interact with the APP called Clinton on an iPad together how.

198
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:58.950
Nick LaLone: How did people change the way that they related to one another, and if I look at types of association or like human to human human to non human non human to non human.

199
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:13.590
Nick LaLone: What are the different types of associations that matter, the most to that particular modality and then what afforded says does physical do this physical play provided the user to the user that virtual plate is not so.

200
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:31.980
Nick LaLone: When computer starts mediating a space what's the impact of that and in looking at it, is there a way for us to do that now what ends up happening is all of these silly looking social network maps and all I want to point to for this particular thing is that this is a.

201
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:43.770
Nick LaLone: visualization of a particular iPad mediated game, and if you look right in the middle, there is this trade icon.

202
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.930
Nick LaLone: I think I can actually annotate it campaign yeah and.

203
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.160
turn it off.

204
00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:02.550
Nick LaLone: And so, this trade icon, this is the only button in the iPad game that will actually prompt me to hand the iPad to another person.

205
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:11.160
Nick LaLone: every other aspect of this game is being mediated by this network over here, which is essentially the iPad itself.

206
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:21.030
Nick LaLone: And the players, all that they can really do is interact with each other in order for them to interact with the game they have to hold the object that is actually mediating the game itself.

207
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:30.690
Nick LaLone: And so, this continues, as we move forward, apparently, I need to now we'll just leave them there.

208
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:42.150
Nick LaLone: And if you start adding up all the different associations their central cities and things like that in the digital games, the iPad is the most dominant object on the entire game.

209
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:50.730
Nick LaLone: And there isn't anything that you can really do about it, it the humans are completely disconnected from the activity itself.

210
00:35:51.210 --> 00:36:00.570
Nick LaLone: they're interacting with the game, but they're interacting with the game as mediated by the iPad now when you start moving into the analog version of play.

211
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:13.500
Nick LaLone: everything's relatively balanced, there is no dominant actor, aside from the humans themselves, and then the cards The game board the resources, all of these things are evenly distributed.

212
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:21.600
Nick LaLone: And this continues on through everything and whatever essentially done with this method is i've taken the least.

213
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.820
Nick LaLone: i'm.

214
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:35.610
Nick LaLone: There we go I figured it out i've taken into the the mode ads themselves, these are the most least reducible object, and I have essentially map them i've created a motorhead map.

215
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:44.880
Nick LaLone: And this is getting back into a long discussion that began, all the way back with Newton and line lead minutes and never say that name correctly.

216
00:36:45.450 --> 00:37:03.840
Nick LaLone: And sort of the finding of this particular thing is when the iPad takes over human centrality the humans matter 40 at an average of 40% less than when they're actually playing the game in front of each other and so with that i'm a minute overtime apologies for that.

217
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:09.180
Nick LaLone: i'll leave questions and comments for when we start discussing later and i'll turn everything over.

218
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.090
Nick LaLone: To jack himself.

219
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.530
Jack Murray: And thanks Nick let's see.

220
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.010
Nick LaLone: Can I get rid of all my presenter notes and started to wing it, so I hope I wasn't too weird.

221
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:24.450
Nick LaLone: All right.

222
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.620
Jack Murray: Can we all see.

223
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.230
Jack Murray: The PowerPoint.

224
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:30.690
Nick LaLone: Yes.

225
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.550
Jack Murray: Okay um.

226
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.160
And let me.

227
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.230
Whereas.

228
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.690
Jack Murray: There is linked to my slides.

229
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.000
Jack Murray: and

230
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:57.450
Jack Murray: So Hello again everyone, my name is jack Murray, I am a PhD student in the text and technology program at the University of central Florida.

231
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:04.050
Jack Murray: my presentation is going to be a more theoretical angle on some of the themes that we've already covered.

232
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:16.350
Jack Murray: So I am primarily interested in the way that analog games and play mediate effect and what happens when analog games are translated into digital formats.

233
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:29.880
Jack Murray: So for brief roadmap, I want to discuss briefly how analog games exist as platforms how these platforms do the work of mediating effects and different approaches to adaptation and their effects on play.

234
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.950
Jack Murray: So what does it mean when I say analog answer platforms.

235
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:39.480
what's.

236
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:55.980
Jack Murray: For me, an analog platform is an assemblage of the material components, the codified rules and procedures, as well as the social context.

237
00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:11.730
Jack Murray: Of the players and the environment that, and you know the environment that they're playing and etc, and how the game and how that impacts how the game is played so taken together they become this assemblage for analog play that functions as a platform that immediate effect.

238
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:21.840
Jack Murray: So Africa, broadly speaking, is a way of thinking about the in articulable process of feeling, how do we feel, how do things influence how we feel.

239
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:32.430
Jack Murray: aubrey animal uses aspect to refer to the aspects of emotions feelings and bodily engagements that circulate through people and things but are often registered only at the interface.

240
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:41.490
Jack Murray: Here the interfaces taken literally to mean the interface of an object, such as the touchscreen have a phone or a tablet that animal basis for analysis on.

241
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:52.800
Jack Murray: However, interface can also be understood as the points of contact between objects that emerged from their position within a network of aspect aspect is interested in the interrelations in the intensities.

242
00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:06.600
Jack Murray: Of the relations between bodies, and this is what makes fx useful for studying analog games as platforms in that they specifically mediate, the effective relations through contact and interplay between members of the assemblage.

243
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:12.840
Jack Murray: effect plays an important part and how a subject comes to know, understand and interact with the material conditions of.

244
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:14.670
Jack Murray: of being.

245
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.670
Jack Murray: So.

246
00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.610
Jack Murray: effect is particularly susceptible to processes of mediation as a.

247
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:33.000
Jack Murray: As an assemblage analog game for form a mediating role that influences both the capacity to be effective and the capacity to be affected by orienting players towards.

248
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:42.330
Jack Murray: The game as a platform called world notes that board game aesthetics, like the rules that structure their play are essentially political and they organize the relationship between play.

249
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:50.700
Jack Murray: between players for game structures play so to do the structure feelings, in other words games that replicates familiar effective structures.

250
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:58.890
Jack Murray: That provide a Friday framework for effective responses, based on the subject position within that network.

251
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:13.590
Jack Murray: The relationship within analog game retain the flexibility of an effect as a system of potential in this dynamic has afforded by the interactions between the rules, the components and the capacity for the game to game and players to enforce not only formal structures.

252
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.060
Jack Murray: or.

253
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:27.240
Jack Murray: To enforce formal structures, but also by employing whatever militaria calls aspect of structuring what area suggests that effect of structuring is an informal mechanism.

254
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:35.340
Jack Murray: That allows games to facilitate play through queuing and priming of certain emotional responses and the interpolation of certain relational subject positions in players.

255
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:44.520
Jack Murray: Effective structuring precisely describes how analog games game platforms act isn't orienting force for the varying levels of effective intensity.

256
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.900
Jack Murray: So what does it mean to orient affect.

257
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:57.750
Jack Murray: To answer this question i'm going to draw on the concept of intimacy looking at it through a queer theory framework and the most common definitions tend to focus on.

258
00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:07.950
Jack Murray: belonging and connection through kind of embodied and carnal sensuality, however, other queer theory scholars have described intimacy as a sensuous closeness through points of physical contact.

259
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.120
Jack Murray: It describes the ability for the relationships between.

260
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.460
Topher Maraffi: jack we can hear you yeah.

261
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.510
Nick LaLone: I don't think he can hear us either.

262
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.310
Topher Maraffi: I don't think so either.

263
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.930
Nick LaLone: me see i'm going to click on the mute button.

264
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.570
Topher Maraffi: You can ask him to unmute.

265
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.930
Jack Murray: yeah that's awkward my headset just died.

266
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:25.500
Nick LaLone: I.

267
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.000
Jack Murray: don't know how long ago it died.

268
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:32.580
Nick LaLone: it's only like about a minute here okay sorry I took drastic measures.

269
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.400
Jack Murray: All right, well, hopefully uh.

270
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.680
Jack Murray: Hopefully.

271
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.270
Topher Maraffi: We didn't hear much about the intimacy slide.

272
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.460
Jack Murray: Okay, so basically.

273
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.570
Jack Murray: The point of intimacy is that is a specific way that.

274
00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:08.100
Jack Murray: An effect gets mediated and oriented, so instead of so if an effect operates on intensities then desire helps orient those intensities and so.

275
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:17.100
Jack Murray: Essentially, intimacy becomes a vector for an effect where the intensity is the.

276
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:26.700
Jack Murray: i'm forgetting all my science words magnitude and and then desire operates as the direction.

277
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:43.110
Jack Murray: So, moving on to this first kind of case study is cat Katherine staples Nick to phobia and automatically draws on classic crooks from Horn slasher films by pitting one player, as the slasher versus the remaining players as the hunted.

278
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:54.750
Jack Murray: The goal is intuitively simple the hunted must escape the forest and the hunter must incapacitate the hunted before before they're able to escape the twist is that the hundred players.

279
00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:00.150
Jack Murray: are required to wear blackout glasses and play entirely by touch.

280
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.260
Jack Murray: Simple design this game, so that it could be played with people.

281
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.200
Jack Murray: With visual impairments, and as a result, the design paste careful attention to the technology of components.

282
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.530
Jack Murray: Other games use this deprivation of sight.

283
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.750
Jack Murray: In order to.

284
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.320
Jack Murray: obscure information, whereas Nick to phobia uses it.

285
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:36.240
Jack Murray: removes vision from the players for the duration of the game to set up specific relationships, so in playing dicta phobia players engage in a micro level what lane noon, he calls.

286
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:45.780
Jack Murray: spelunking, which is an intentionally disorienting and precise experience that opens players up to effective relationships within the apparatus of play.

287
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:53.610
Jack Murray: The Board for Nick phobia itself is a vacuum form shelf plastic with alternating circular divots you can see a picture of it here and the tokens.

288
00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:00.180
Jack Murray: and smaller holes were barriers barriers form.

289
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:10.440
Jack Murray: But trees yeah so there's a lot of attention played to the materiality of of these objects, so the effect is one of players.

290
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.620
Jack Murray: fumbling around exploring the game components, with their hands in order to determine information.

291
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:26.070
Jack Murray: So, in order to prevent the players from scattering the game pieces across the table or otherwise slowing down the pace of play, Nick to phobia relies on the hunter player who maintains their site.

292
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:32.910
Jack Murray: So that, in addition to their antagonistic relationship with the other players, the hunter must also facilitate.

293
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:42.180
Jack Murray: certain kinds of play this comes in part through the turn to turn administration necessitated by systems of game rules and the procedures as well.

294
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:48.900
Jack Murray: Additionally, and perhaps more interestingly, the hunter guides their players to their pieces by physically touching and moving their hands.

295
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.250
Jack Murray: touch interactive phobia opens a state of effective vulnerability.

296
00:46:54.120 --> 00:47:01.440
Jack Murray: between players that denotes the willingness or ability to be affected by another player, which points other players are which points.

297
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:12.150
Jack Murray: them all, towards the place in bludgeoned specific ways, so this process of orienting players are first disorienting and then reorienting the players towards the assemblage of play.

298
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:27.960
Jack Murray: Is a kind of intimacy and this kind of orientation highlights the oscillation between the subject position within their to space of the game, as well as the position of the players playing the game Nick the phobia makes this process yeah even more explicit.

299
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.560
Jack Murray: By for grounding the possibilities of intimacy through the materiality of the game and the relationships between players.

300
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:37.950
yeah.

301
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:41.190
Jack Murray: And so.

302
00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.690
Jack Murray: The it's important to note that this effect is not.

303
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.670
Jack Murray: unique connected phobia and touches not the only way intimacy emerges through games.

304
00:47:52.290 --> 00:48:01.410
Jack Murray: Through games and play so in the trading card game magic the gathering this connection between players emerges through what mclaughlin calls instrumental intimacy.

305
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:16.530
Jack Murray: in which the connections are constrained by normative aspirations and ideals in this case the competitive nature of magic brings players into an antagonistic relationship defined by the desire to win held intention with a desire to continue playing the game.

306
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.190
Jack Murray: And so, as.

307
00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:30.030
Jack Murray: Generally, as a platform magic is more expensive than Nick to phobia in that it encompasses a wider field of social and cultural dynamics that.

308
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:36.420
Jack Murray: determine how the game is played where it's played who gets to play it and how it is interacted with.

309
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:49.140
Jack Murray: So, whereas Nick phobia exemplifies how games construct intimacy magic highlights the scope of play that happens beyond just the bounds of an individual game where people two people sit down to play cards with each other.

310
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.790
Jack Murray: So this This also includes.

311
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:07.890
Jack Murray: Discussions of social aspects, such as discuss discussions of magic analyzing the Meta game engaging with the fiction and even the intricate economic systems that are supported by the game.

312
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:18.180
Jack Murray: The effective network encompassed by magic, the gathering is somewhat larger than Nick to phobia but nonetheless nonetheless relies on specific effect or similar effective vectors.

313
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:27.690
Jack Murray: So that leads us to the The big question what happens when these Games are translated into digital platforms for this i'm turning to.

314
00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:34.560
Jack Murray: Bolton gruesome theory of remediation that describes the representation of one medium within another.

315
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:43.680
Jack Murray: And that this is a process of cultural competition between or among technologies that define themselves by borrowing from paying homage to critiquing.

316
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:58.860
Jack Murray: And refashioning the predecessors, we might also think about this as a form of adaptation that highlights a relationship between the two objects, the original in the adaptation and the relationship between those two things and the entire own objects that press upon them.

317
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:10.230
Jack Murray: The process of remediation exists on an axis of hypermedia see on one end and immediacy, on the other, whereas immediacy described the tendency or desire.

318
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:25.890
Jack Murray: For the interface for the interface of an object completely disappear erasing the gap between representation and the object, it is representing by seeking to mimic the original media as closely as possible hypermedia see on the other hand.

319
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.680
Jack Murray: acknowledges this this difference between the representation, the original object and kind of runs with it.

320
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:42.750
Jack Murray: So as a way to illustrate here, I have some popular adaptations of magic the gathering, which I chose for Nick to phobia because i've yet to find anyone who's figured out how to play an active phobia digitally.

321
00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:57.570
Jack Murray: So on the immediacy end of the spectrum, we have platforms, such as magic the gathering arena and spell table which both take different approaches to allow allow players to play magic remotely spell table is.

322
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:03.780
Jack Murray: Using webcams and you play with paper magic cards, whereas magic the gathering arena is.

323
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.550
Jack Murray: primarily on.

324
00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.950
Jack Murray: is entirely digital platform.

325
00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:22.980
Jack Murray: So, and then towards the hypermedia end of the spectrum, we have tabletop simulator which explicitly highlights the kind of digital element, it is.

326
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:30.780
Jack Murray: It rebels in the awkwardness of its interface of trying to do the things you would do in a physical space.

327
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.350
Jack Murray: exaggerated through a digital medium.

328
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:46.740
Jack Murray: So while it's not explicitly magic the gathering simulator you can play magic the gathering in it, and it is a gleefully digital representation of what it is like to play magic on the table.

329
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:59.880
Jack Murray: So in this end of the spectrum, we also have the 1997 computer rpg magic the gathering shandel are where instead of just playing magic you play a wizard who travels through the world of magic playing magic with people.

330
00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:19.170
Jack Murray: So shandel our aims for a a drastically different experience than that of some of the other magic the gathering adaptations, instead of leaning into the connection between the players it's more interested interested in providing a somatic experience.

331
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:27.060
Jack Murray: It also highlights the shortcomings of this of this singular axis instead of purely replicating.

332
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:37.920
Jack Murray: The platform of magic shandel our attempts to capture a specific aspect associated with playing the game so for this I turned to something I got from Cameron councilman.

333
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:50.760
Jack Murray: Who described offers a description of effective versus subjective adaptations here aspect of experiences are interested in replicating the particular feelings of an object and and consultants.

334
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.120
Jack Murray: example, this involves playing.

335
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.830
Jack Murray: Within the world of the film, but not necessarily a specific character within the film.

336
00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:10.620
Jack Murray: subjective experiences, on the other hand, enforce a specific subject position on the player so, for example, playing a film character in a game that's based on the film, so this is when you play legalese in one of the Lord of the Rings games.

337
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:22.980
Jack Murray: So, because of so this doesn't map cleanly on to analog to digital adaptations because players as we discussed earlier players inhabit this.

338
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:32.250
Jack Murray: Both a narrative subject position within the game, and the position of someone playing the game, though I think it's still useful to identify.

339
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:41.040
Jack Murray: What experiences, the adaptation is interested in replicating so if we add an access access onto the graph that describes with the magic or narrative decision.

340
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.960
Jack Murray: On the top end and the lunatic on the bottom we get something kind of like this.

341
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:55.950
Jack Murray: So we see arena spell table and tabletop simulator end up near the bottom is there, explicitly interested in the ludic experience of sitting at a table playing magic the gathering.

342
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:06.090
Jack Murray: chandelier ends up slightly above the middle, because while it's still includes the card game, it is more interested in you playing a character that exists within the narrative world of magic the gathering.

343
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.190
Jack Murray: And then, at the top of the chart towards the hypermedia see and we have.

344
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:21.030
Jack Murray: Things like magic the gathering battle major, which is also from 1997, which is a real time strategy game set in the magic the gathering universe, where you play cards summon creatures and then command them around the battlefield.

345
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.700
Jack Murray: Which is a.

346
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:34.980
Jack Murray: imagined as a live action version of what is the magically happening within more when you sit down to play with paper magic cards and then more recent game.

347
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:46.500
Jack Murray: magic the gathering legends, which is a Diablo style action rpg that's just setting the magic universe, and you get to play as character established characters.

348
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:55.440
Jack Murray: So both battle mage and legends are introduced interested in primarily adapting the thematic element of magic but not necessarily the traditional experience of.

349
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:06.090
Jack Murray: The magic the gathering as it pertains to the platform centered around the trading card game, so I want to end with kind of a question kind of a provocation.

350
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:20.070
Jack Murray: When remediating or adapting an analog game to a digital platform, the relationships within the place and village change the effective vector shifts depending on the aspect of the original.

351
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:29.280
Jack Murray: That the adaptation is attempting to preserve and what it and what what it changes so when engaging with a digital version of the object.

352
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:40.620
Jack Murray: What experiences get maintained what gets changed what gets lost, how does the platform orient the player reader user or otherwise.

353
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.580
Jack Murray: Part participating interactive towards the network of aspect there so subsequently and mashed within.

354
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:55.500
Jack Murray: And so, with that Thank you and we will open up for some q&a.

355
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.820
Nick LaLone: So applause for both of you.

356
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.830
Topher Maraffi: Likewise.

357
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.490
Jack Murray: So I I lost I did lose audio.

358
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:32.970
Jack Murray: And that, so I apologize for that at some point I should replace this headset because this is the second time it's happened at a conference.

359
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:39.660
Jack Murray: So do we have.

360
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:44.850
Jack Murray: Any questions from.

361
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.230
Jack Murray: The chat that I missed did anyone see.

362
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.670
I don't see any questions.

363
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.200
All right.

364
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:14.820
Alan.

365
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:23.910
Alan Sondheim: i'm just wondering what kind of effect what was the name of the one with the intimacy with the touch.

366
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:25.950
Jack Murray: Nick de phobia.

367
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:30.960
Alan Sondheim: Nikki focus, what kind of effect do you think this would have on players long term.

368
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:34.320
Jack Murray: In terms of.

369
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:50.460
Alan Sondheim: Another words if if people are uncomfortable touching each other, does this create a sense of intimacy or is there a kind of alienation because you don't really know who you're touching or I mean it seems to have psychological issues really built into it, which is fascinating.

370
00:57:51.060 --> 00:58:11.820
Jack Murray: yeah so it's it you're correct it is really interesting it oftentimes there's a lot of discussion around like consent and setting boundaries before play begins in that way, it takes a lot of cues from things like Nordic alarp which have a variety of.

371
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:18.000
Jack Murray: Mechanisms for kind of mediating mediating intimacy and so.

372
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.720
Jack Murray: But yeah even beyond that.

373
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.780
Jack Murray: it's a it's a an odd experience because.

374
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:43.260
Jack Murray: It does have the potential for to like highlight the negative the kind of negative intimacy so part of one of the things that I that probably got I got cut off was that, like intimacy is not always a good thing.

375
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:48.660
Jack Murray: And that and based on how that intimacy is deployed.

376
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:50.670
Jack Murray: It can.

377
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.810
Jack Murray: Like quickly change the experience of play.

378
00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:01.230
Alan Sondheim: It seems to also reflect relate to test it knowledge.

379
00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:10.680
Alan Sondheim: I play kind of experimental guitar and i'll do with my eyes closed sometimes and even wearing your phone, so I can't hear what i'm doing and just feeling.

380
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:18.330
Alan Sondheim: So there's there's something about remapping your whole body in a situation like that, and the kind of memory that goes along with it.

381
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:21.270
Jack Murray: yeah exactly.

382
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:23.880
Jack Murray: So I.

383
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:36.000
Nick LaLone: Have there's a question from Dan Cox how am I effect of vectors and your work and mapping along the axis of remediation work for things like D amp D enroll 20 or fantasy grounds.

384
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:44.520
Jack Murray: yeah so that was another thing that I that i've been thinking about and it functions somewhat similarly so.

385
00:59:47.790 --> 01:00:08.280
Jack Murray: Well, also somewhat differently depending so like I would say that, like the things that are more thematically oriented end up being like the early computer rpg it because they are like explicitly making dungeons and dragons for the computer, whereas.

386
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.440
Jack Murray: Something like.

387
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:18.060
Jack Murray: or fantasy grounds would be more interested in.

388
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:19.560
Jack Murray: You know.

389
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:30.240
Jack Murray: replicating the experience of sitting down and playing at the table so they'd be closer to something like arena or spell table.

390
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:38.580
Jack Murray: And yeah, so this is this isn't kind of figuring out this relationship is kind of an ongoing process.

391
01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:41.640
Jack Murray: That.

392
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:48.510
Jack Murray: So this is like my third or fourth version of this kind of graph i'm trying to figure out like what.

393
01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:54.060
Jack Murray: What does it look like in these kind of situations.

394
01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:03.780
Nick LaLone: that's good answer um so there's another question here about ar and I think that this is something interesting.

395
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:12.840
Nick LaLone: For Devon there's a bunch of papers by I think it the two authors are IP IP and Cooper stuck they talk about playing content on a light table.

396
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:26.460
Nick LaLone: But they, the question is how do ar platforms factor into sort of this conversation of materiality and then they link to the tilt five sort of ar experience on the table.

397
01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:41.580
Topher Maraffi: So yeah I think I think that's very I haven't actually played till five but it looks very interesting.

398
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:49.680
Topher Maraffi: You know I mean going from from material that digital it changes so much.

399
01:01:50.730 --> 01:02:02.940
Topher Maraffi: I do think that it's an open research area in vr or ar to make it feel more real to make it for feel more material.

400
01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:12.180
Topher Maraffi: So that when you're you know you're in the lot of these platforms, where you're using vr ar or Mr.

401
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:39.480
Topher Maraffi: You can see your hand sometimes and it it's just a representation of you pushing the controller buttons, but it does feel like your hands, after a while and and depending on how well the haptics are implemented in the touching of things, it can actually feel like you're touching something.

402
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:53.130
Topher Maraffi: Like if you're playing beat saver and vr you actually feel yourself cut what you would think because nobody really knows what a lightsaber would feel like cutting through a block.

403
01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:02.610
Topher Maraffi: As your your digital life slaver is going through a blocks that are going by, and so I think that.

404
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:11.940
Topher Maraffi: that's kind of like the goal of a lot of these platforms is to try and bring more of that feeling of that materiality over.

405
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:25.530
Topher Maraffi: As an aesthetic and and so things like the void vr experience, where they actually have you touch a lot of things that are actually physical things.

406
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.640
Topher Maraffi: If you took your glasses off they wouldn't look anything like what they look like.

407
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:39.240
Topher Maraffi: In the virtual world, but you know it makes all the difference to the illusion that when you grab this lever there's actually a lever there.

408
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:53.250
Topher Maraffi: Where you don't get that in the home vr experience so, so I think that there's there's levels of theatricality to bring that illusion into the virtual world.

409
01:03:54.630 --> 01:04:04.770
Topher Maraffi: And the more you can do it in a way that is seamless it's it's really pretty amazing It makes you it grounds, you in that experience even more.

410
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:21.390
Nick LaLone: In thinking about fertilizing board games there used to be a version of scrabble where you're sort of tray for your letters was your iPhone.

411
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:31.590
Nick LaLone: And the board itself was on an iPad, and so this game, you know, in order for you to play it you had to have spent something like what seven $8,000.

412
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.120
Nick LaLone: And I think that a lot of the the reasons for not.

413
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:50.490
Nick LaLone: Like we're sort of touching on some of this stuff like what's the potentials because what we don't know really how to study it right what what's good in this particular regard, and then to this stuff is very inaccessible.

414
01:04:51.030 --> 01:05:05.790
Nick LaLone: The amount of money, you need to use like till five or something like that is a it's prohibitive in a lot of ways I keep coming back to golem arcana which sadly wasn't really implemented very well, but.

415
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:13.590
Nick LaLone: All of the little miniatures you know these are things that you could touch all of their information was stored.

416
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:25.050
Nick LaLone: On an APP and so you had to touch rf tags on the miniatures so that you can do this, I think there's different ways for you to kind of mediate sort of the procedures of play with the materials of play.

417
01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:31.410
Nick LaLone: And I hope that people will start trying different things as we move forward yeah.

418
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:43.800
Jack Murray: i'm i'm thinking about things like recently or I guess several years ago, keep talking nobody explodes where you have one person who has the headset and then everyone else is given a pamphlet.

419
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:47.820
Jack Murray: or even something like the battle tech pods.

420
01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.490
Jack Murray: which I get it's it's.

421
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:57.240
Jack Murray: Not it's like an interesting like mixed reality kind of experience and.

422
01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:06.360
Topher Maraffi: Personally, I mean I don't really think you should adapt I mean well I don't know if you should but I don't think it's.

423
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.620
Topher Maraffi: A good use of the medium if you're not changing it.

424
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:21.570
Topher Maraffi: When you're going from the physical game to the virtual game, I mean I really love the idea I haven't played it of the.

425
01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:30.510
Topher Maraffi: The magic the gathering one channel or where you're a wizard going around playing the game in the in the in the game world.

426
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:37.170
Topher Maraffi: You know that sort of Meta narrative within or Meta play inside of the the game.

427
01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:48.450
Topher Maraffi: So you know, I think that you might I like I like the idea of exploring how does it change it.

428
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:58.710
Topher Maraffi: Rather than trying to keep it the same, although I can see where the one reason why you would want to maybe completely.

429
01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:09.780
Topher Maraffi: Say create a digital version of a board game, would be to be able to play with people that are, on the other side of the world, you know who are not in your space at all.

430
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:21.540
Topher Maraffi: Especially with coven and everything, and in that case I mean there are certain things you'd want to replicate to give that feeling of the real game like I play.

431
01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:33.840
Topher Maraffi: dominoes and Mexican train a lot, and one of the things is the sound of those you know the sound of the dominoes hitting each other when you move them around you would want to replicate that if you if you wanted to.

432
01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:39.600
Topher Maraffi: sort of make a digital version that you could play with people somewhere else but.

433
01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:48.450
Nick LaLone: there's an interesting thing, I think that happens when you digitize a game, because, like the analog the physical space, the tabletop space.

434
01:07:49.980 --> 01:08:04.380
Nick LaLone: Humans are imperfect, and so we often will finish a game and then realize oh I missed a rule 20 turns back this is especially prevalent in magic because there's so many different interactions with cards and things like that.

435
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:12.150
Nick LaLone: almost universally when I was experimenting with trying to figure out how to measure what happens during play.

436
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:23.940
Nick LaLone: When I handed the players, an iPad and told them to play another game of content, using just this They all said oh i've been misinterpreting that rule for a long time.

437
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:36.210
Nick LaLone: And so, this is where like yes, you should take advantages advantage of the medium, but the recognition that like computers can't make exceptions to the way that they're programmed.

438
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:44.460
Nick LaLone: And so you're the procedures of a tabletop game, especially where, especially in like magic and things like that.

439
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:55.560
Nick LaLone: They become a lot more strict and I think that this tends to sort of take away from the human factor on the board game.

440
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.170
Nick LaLone: But yeah I don't know yeah.

441
01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:04.140
Jack Murray: I think that's one of the reasons why things like spell table or tabletop simulator especially are.

442
01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:09.000
Jack Murray: Interesting is because it's it doesn't.

443
01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:18.150
Jack Murray: It still relies on the the human aspect to follow the procedures of the game and like execute this this like.

444
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.280
Jack Murray: These processes.

445
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:34.410
Nick LaLone: So I had a question that's actually relevant to what we're talking about now and I guess, this would be for you drag, which is that um so like you can play magic on things like lackey gimp octagon.

446
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:42.150
Nick LaLone: Why are you going to incorporate those types of platforms into your.

447
01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:44.070
Jack Murray: yeah.

448
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:45.390
Jack Murray: it's definitely.

449
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:52.170
Jack Murray: Something that I want to look into is like what are the ways that games like magic are.

450
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:57.660
Jack Murray: being adapted to digital play and what.

451
01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:03.960
Jack Murray: What are the impacts of that so like one of the things I was talking to someone about how.

452
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:19.860
Jack Murray: they're a lot of the language and how they write matt magic cards is changing, because of the emphasis on arena so before, when you would play magic generally, you would have your your deck of 60 cards with like 15 card sideboard that you could swap cards in from.

453
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:32.970
Jack Murray: And so, like as you would play people you would swap cards in and out but for magic but for arena, since you generally match with the person, a random person one time play one game and then disconnect and never see them again.

454
01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:42.000
Jack Murray: they're starting to print a lot of cards that are either or so it's do this or this so it gives you more options, without having to.

455
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:49.530
Jack Murray: split things, or even a lot of the language is getting less vague and more.

456
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:56.040
Jack Murray: almost like you would do like a write a natural language processing Program.

457
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.310
Nick LaLone: cards band iterative but not in the paper version that's the.

458
01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:05.970
Jack Murray: last thing.

459
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:11.850
Nick LaLone: that this has been a project that we've been trying to get off the ground for a while.

460
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.580
Nick LaLone: has to do with.

461
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.410
Nick LaLone: How charisma, the charisma.

462
01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:28.890
Nick LaLone: attribute changed and dungeons and dragons across all of its disparate additions, because when D amp D was digitized.

463
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:39.990
Nick LaLone: charisma was the most powerful staton the entire game right all of the road likes all of the early versions of dungeons and dragons they ignored charisma, because.

464
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:47.760
Nick LaLone: It also meant that your retinue that giant amount of creatures that are following you around they couldn't follow you into the dungeon and so.

465
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:58.740
Nick LaLone: If you watch it from its early first release in the one box and 74 getting into first edition in like 81 or 81 getting into second edition, you see this sort of retreat.

466
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:13.170
Nick LaLone: Back in taking charisma and sort of taking a lot of the word game out of dungeons and dragons and putting it more into the emphasis of this performative clay is super interesting to watch but it's.

467
01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:22.680
Nick LaLone: watching this sort of interplay of dungeons and dragons and our relationship to systems, our relationship to computation the sort of.

468
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:34.440
Nick LaLone: spread of our acceptance of like automated procedures it's really affected dungeon dragons and it's really interesting to see where we are at this particular moment.

469
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:46.110
Nick LaLone: Where dungeon dragons has sort of gone backwards, all the way to that 1974 dungeon exploration type game and there's just so much out there that.

470
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:50.880
Nick LaLone: needs to be explored more in this particular space.

471
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:52.650
Nick LaLone: So.

472
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:57.180
Topher Maraffi: Nick have you made one of those maps for dungeons and dragons.

473
01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.440
Nick LaLone: Which map.

474
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.000
Topher Maraffi: The the.

475
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.160
Nick LaLone: Oh, my the social hour guys this.

476
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.590
Nick LaLone: Is um you said map.

477
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:15.630
Nick LaLone: i've written like three different papers on cartography cartographic experiences at the table, mostly because emergency management its central figure is a map.

478
01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:30.720
Nick LaLone: Right, where are the people that need help, how where our assets in the field and so evaluating how the map in our the way that we interact with maps over time changes, but in terms of social network analysis of playing d&d who.

479
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:42.360
Nick LaLone: Like what I was trying to do, took hundreds and hundreds of hours and there's ways for me to accelerate it doing that for dmd would be super interesting.

480
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:50.550
Nick LaLone: But I have to wonder like, how do you adjust for people starting to figure their characters out over time.

481
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:59.490
Nick LaLone: Right when people come into dungeons and dragons when they come into like a board game they might not understand the rules, but after the first time they play you got a pretty good idea on it.

482
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:07.740
Nick LaLone: Pretty end you're like well this time i'm going to play a ranger and i'm going to use this kit from this specific book and I might use these specific things, how do I.

483
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:18.360
Nick LaLone: bring all of that stuff in to analysis I don't know I mean you could do it, but it would be extremely painstaking very time sensitive.

484
01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:29.550
Jack Murray: It also be interesting to consider like at that point, what counts as like pieces of the game, because you know there's the joke that like snacks are an important part of every dungeons and dragons experience or.

485
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:38.010
Jack Murray: You know, things like that, so I think it'd be especially since there's no prescribed pre prescribed turn order.

486
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:42.450
Jack Murray: Things things like that get get messy like how.

487
01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:58.920
Nick LaLone: what's the one there's an APP for chrome and add on for chrome that feeds into roll 20 from the D amp D s thing and it puts all these buttons into.

488
01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:08.880
Nick LaLone: Roll 20 so it mediates all the rules, you don't need to know anything anymore, as long as your character is created correctly, you just push a button and you're like okay.

489
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:18.960
Nick LaLone: And it makes me think about like my favorite board games and a lot of the Board games that we played when I was more active in that space we're all faceless like we played amber.

490
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:29.760
Nick LaLone: chronicles of amber we play a lot of big eyes small mouth, which is just three Stat but body mind and soul, and so we were almost entirely an improv troupe.

491
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:40.440
Nick LaLone: seeing a D amp D, which has really gone back into like trying to have a ton of rules, so that people, it can except any kind of person.

492
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:44.310
Nick LaLone: there's a lot there that needs to be unpacked.

493
01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:58.020
Nick LaLone: And this is what we've been really trying to dig into with some of our our analysis at this particular point but yeah it's there's so much to unpack there I don't know when you can.

494
01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:04.530
Nick LaLone: yeah.

495
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:09.150
Nick LaLone: you're not allowed to use that spec anymore it's too powerful.

496
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:20.820
Nick LaLone: it's I still think fourth edition from D amp D is probably the most interesting for academic inquiry.

497
01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:32.220
Nick LaLone: Because it was the moment in time, where like video games informed the dungeons and dragons so much that it reflected video games and then fifth edition retreats all the way back to the beginning.

498
01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:40.710
Nick LaLone: Oh no it isn't talked about enough like it is a It is amazing this it's this tiny little moment in time.

499
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:55.920
Nick LaLone: Like right after the World Trade Center disaster, all the way up until like net culture starts to explode and it's just fourth edition represents that space it's like watching the fifth rocky movie and you're like I don't like this, but also the 90s were crazy and terrible.

500
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.230
Nick LaLone: You just have to accept that.

501
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.550
Jack Murray: So I will note that we're a little bit over time.

502
01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:07.440
