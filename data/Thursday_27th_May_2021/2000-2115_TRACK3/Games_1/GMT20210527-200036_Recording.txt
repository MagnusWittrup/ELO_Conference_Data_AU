00:29:35	Nick LaLone:	Question: What's the best version of clue?
00:30:23	Krista-Lee:	Firefly - and if it hasn't been made yet I still say It is the best
00:33:41	Nick LaLone:	Clausewitz's opening salvo about how badly wargames will prepare anyone for war is a great opening salvo about ludology
00:38:33	Nick LaLone:	First 20 years of the 1900s had so much to say about a computer-mediated world.
00:46:42	Krista-Lee:	this conf feels pretty diverse - you shouldn't apologize for that
00:46:57	Nick LaLone:	Slide Deck: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9mo39868jgkdzl6/LaLone%20-%20ELO.pptx?dl=0Medium post about this: https://nick-lalone.medium.com/games-as-summary-6b2d112c43ae
00:47:17	Alan Sondheim:	and in fact it is as much e-lit as everything else! :-)
00:48:03	Daniel Cox:	We can see the presenter notes.
00:48:15	Krista-Lee:	its like cheating
00:55:06	Alan Sondheim:	the Tournier book is amazing!!
01:04:07	Nick LaLone:	I love it so much
01:04:14	Jack Murray:	https://www.jackademia.com/files/ELOppp.pdf
01:04:37	Nick LaLone:	Tournier's book and the Dispossessed from Ursula K LeGuin would be the 2 textbooks if I ever teach sociology again
01:04:50	Krista-Lee:	so many ppl in florida - I think I missed something
01:05:03	Nick LaLone:	Florida man is also a fantastic recruiter I guess.
01:05:09	Krista-Lee:	lmao
01:06:08	Daniel Cox:	It's probably just that ELO has been promoted internally to T&T students.
01:06:26	Nick LaLone:	Evan! I hope he finished his phd.
01:07:50	Alan Sondheim:	they're also somatic and psychological
01:08:54	Krista-Lee:	i lost audio
01:08:59	Krista-Lee:	is it me or them?
01:09:00	Nick LaLone:	Also lost audio
01:09:07	Erin Kathleen Bahl:	lost audio
01:09:09	Anastasia Salter:	yep
01:09:10	Alan Sondheim:	lost audio as well
01:09:23	Krista-Lee:	don't think he can hear us
01:09:43	Krista-Lee:	if he was a twitch streamer he'd be reading chat ll
01:10:11	Krista-Lee:	welcome back jack
01:11:03	Krista-Lee:	English is hard - we all forget the words
01:11:30	Nick LaLone:	ole nyctaphobia. When my dislike of being touched meets my interest in weird games
01:14:26	Nick LaLone:	Nicktophobia. Fear of the Nick-hivemind.
01:17:25	Nick LaLone:	Rumble control and a blank screen
01:17:42	Kenton Taylor Howard:	Shandalar is still my favorite MTG game
01:18:01	Nick LaLone:	Paul Dourish's What We Talk About When We Talk About Context is also a great resource for adaptation and design as well.
01:19:46	Nick LaLone:	Gimli only
01:24:43	Kenton Taylor Howard:	Jack, I'd be curious how Magic's adaptations of other narrative content recently (The Walking Dead and the upcoming DnD set come to mind) fit into this.  Is it just different theming or is there more to it? (I can also ask this on voice chat if you prefer)
01:24:50	Daniel Cox:	QUESTION: Jack - How might affective vectors, and your work in mapping along the axis of remediation, work for things like D&D in Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds?
01:25:24	Nick LaLone:	Question for Jack: where do online platforms like Lackey, GEMP, OCTGN, Jinteki fit in with this idea of intimacy?
01:25:53	Devin:	Question: How do AR platforms factor into this conversation? (I am specifically thinking about this device https://www.tiltfive.com/ )
01:26:35	Erin Kathleen Bahl:	thank you all for an excellent panel!
01:28:34	Nick LaLone:	To Virtualize or Not? The Importance of Physical and Virtual Components in Augmented Reality Board Gameshttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_64
01:28:54	Nick LaLone:	PDF link here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_64.pdf
01:32:57	Nick LaLone:	Taking advantage of the potential of the medium
01:35:22	Alan Sondheim:	Dominos are a great example of the relationship between real-life community and game-play - the boards, the different sounds of the pieces on different parts of the table and so forth. It's dirty analog - like the body itself -
01:37:29	Kenton Taylor Howard:	There have been cards that have been banned specifically in Arena and not in the paper magic version
01:37:40	Kenton Taylor Howard:	Because they caused gameplay problems
01:38:31	Kenton Taylor Howard:	This one, if I remember right, is one example: https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nexus+of+Fate
01:38:33	Alan Sondheim:	What kind of cards?
01:39:07	Krista-Lee:	i have to cut out early - but wanted to say thinka you all! Interesting thoughts here
01:39:14	Kenton Taylor Howard:	Basically it was causing problems because games are mostly played one on one online, as Jack mentioned, and it was hard to counter in that format
01:39:14	Jack Murray:	Thanks for coming!
01:39:15	Krista-Lee:	thank you all*
01:39:29	Anastasia Salter:	Thank you!
01:39:30	Alan Sondheim:	Thanks! and thank you all!
01:42:27	Daniel Cox:	There have been new adjustments within hobbyist space to switch up things like spells and feats in D&D between sessions that were "against" the rules -- re-specing, in a digital sense. That's a change from the digital making its way back into the more analog game design space.
01:42:52	Kenton Taylor Howard:	I had to do that in my own recent campaign because a class I was using was changed
01:43:01	Kenton Taylor Howard:	Also I loved 4e and it's not talked about enough!
01:43:50	Alan Sondheim:	thankyou all so much!
01:43:57	Devin:	This was an awesome talk! Thank you to everyone.
01:44:10	Kenton Taylor Howard:	This was a great talk for sure!
