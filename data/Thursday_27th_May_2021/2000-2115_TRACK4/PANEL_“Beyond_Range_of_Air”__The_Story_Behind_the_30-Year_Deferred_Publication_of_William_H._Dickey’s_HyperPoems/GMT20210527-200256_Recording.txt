00:29:34	Deena Larsen:	Andrew our coding her!o
00:32:39	Deena Larsen:	Leonard Sanazaro
00:36:51	Leonardo Flores:	Deena is like Templar, but with authorization.
00:38:13	Deena Larsen:	OI think that laptop is penny/Penelope. Named for  Judy Malloy
00:38:53	Deena Larsen:	And you can see the problems with font, etc. Wonderful archiving Matt! <#
00:38:58	Deena Larsen:	<3
00:39:26	Søren Pold:	Original problems :-)
00:40:06	Deena Larsen:	Leonard, who said anything about authorization?
00:40:22	Leonardo Flores:	;-)
00:41:39	Deena Larsen:	Oh wow they look so young and so happy
00:43:11	Deena Larsen:	Yeah, you should have seen the closets.
00:43:21	Deena Larsen:	Merlyn was the best corgi ever.
00:44:04	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	Mac peeking out on the left of photo
00:44:32	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	Osborne! <3
00:44:52	Deena Larsen:	I lusted after his computers. They were amazing. My god, they had so much RAM.
00:45:57	Deena Larsen:	Bill was amazing--he took in a lowly student from University of Colorado and mentored me as a thesis advisor--for free--even though he taught at UCSF.
00:47:45	Deena Larsen:	THe MIT correspondence was the four poems int he NEw Media Reader
00:49:08	Nick Montfort (he/him):	Which we were delighted to have!
00:49:32	Deena Larsen:	YEs, Nick Monfort was a hero in getting them!!
00:50:01	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	Next. Level.
00:50:04	James Ryan:	so cool!
00:50:09	Nick Montfort (he/him):	Yes!
00:50:15	Lai-Tze Fan:	Wowww!
00:50:25	Winnie Soon:	lol wow
00:50:27	Deena Larsen:	Noah Wardrip Fruin and Nick Monfort created the cannon in the New Media Reader!
00:50:33	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	I’m going to post these links several times. Here are the HyperPoems at the Internet Archive:
00:50:34	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	https://archive.org/details/william_dickey_hyperpoems_volume_1
00:50:37	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	https://archive.org/details/william_dickey_hyperpoems_volume_2
00:50:42	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	Vol. 2 is NSFW.
00:51:14	Deena Larsen:	HyperCard is the best program ever as John McDaid (Uncle Buddy's Funhouse) knows!!!
00:51:36	Deena Larsen:	It is so incredible. You can program every bit--butons and cards and stacks, and oh so many hidden corners for code!
00:51:51	Deena Larsen:	and option A let you see all the hidden buttons.
00:51:57	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	The HyperPoems are fully public. Please feel free to tweet, share links, and whatever else.
00:52:35	Deena Larsen:	Yeah, it basically died. Supercard, etc.
00:52:53	Deena Larsen:	Yes, we need to share the beauty of Dickey's work!!
00:53:29	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	There are reams of scholarship that are waiting to be written on the HyperPoems.
00:53:52	Deena Larsen:	Oh Brilliant!!! Handling the huge variety of stacks!!
00:54:10	Deena Larsen:	Oh wonderful.  We can now see these works. Thank you!!!
00:54:16	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	Super impressive.
00:54:36	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	The in-browser experience was critical for us.
00:54:49	Leonardo Flores:	Yes. It’s necessary these days
00:54:51	Deena Larsen:	We need to find if Monks had Macs...
00:54:51	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	So cool.
00:55:00	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	I’ve got it
00:55:40	Deena Larsen:	Note the floppies!
00:55:54	Deena Larsen:	Oh I love her. Bill showed her to me.
00:56:04	Deena Larsen:	Bill and I read Inigo together.
00:56:18	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	<3
00:56:29	Deena Larsen:	<3
00:56:47	Deena Larsen:	My logic professor had a WFF n Proof game in hypercard
00:57:29	Deena Larsen:	YEah, and the speed of the disk and sound was so important to Dickey's work.
00:57:45	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	What a bone-head decision.
00:58:07	Deena Larsen:	Hey at the time Bill Gates said that 64 K was enough for everyone
00:58:46	Deena Larsen:	Hooray for Classic System 9
00:58:52	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	A so-called “Rosetta computer"
00:59:49	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	It took me forever to get my head around resource forks.
01:00:09	Deena Larsen:	Yeah, the fonts were resources. you had a separate suitcase for fonts, etc.
01:01:00	Deena Larsen:	Bill loved composing the sounds. You could program the sounds (using the resource fork). The user experience was so easy. But the backend is complexicated
01:01:53	Deena Larsen:	THank you for your dedication Andrew~
01:02:46	Nick Montfort (he/him):	Thank you! Wondreful work & a great presentation
01:02:57	Nick Montfort (he/him):	I remember that, Matt!
01:03:24	Nick Montfort (he/him):	In fact it made it into an official ELO report, https://www.eliterature.org/pad/bab.html#sec2.2.1
01:03:34	Susan Tracz:	Great Presentation Andrew!

01:16:27	Winnie Soon:	<3<3
01:16:50	Leonardo Flores:	I keep thinking about how there was an explosion of features and then a paring down.
01:17:18	Leonardo Flores:	In software.
01:17:38	Scott Rettberg:	I love this expression, Deena.

01:18:29	James Ryan:	Matt, I have my copy of Volcano, if you’d like me to show it briefly!
01:18:29	Serge BOUCHARDON:	Very moving Deena... Thank you
01:20:57	Deena Larsen:	Now we have the audience who can appreciate the work.
01:21:08	Deena Larsen:	This is the perfect time. Thank you for reframing my life now Susan!
01:21:21	Leonardo Flores:	It’s extra special
01:21:25	Leonardo Flores:	At this time
01:23:13	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	SO. JEALOUS.
01:23:35	Leonardo Flores:	What a treasure!
01:24:32	Leonardo Flores:	Drop a bomb and then leave. Well played James!
01:25:22	Deena Larsen:	Huge hugs James!!!
01:28:24	Matthew G. Kirschenbaum:	Heresy or Fours
01:30:29	Jessica Pressman:	I can’t believe I wrote down the wrong time for this panel!  (I can’t tell you how many times I have done this over the course of the last year). I will look forward to watching the recording!
01:30:53	Deena Larsen:	Rob Swigart and Bill Dickey took a class together? I found that out later?
01:31:08	Leonardo Flores:	There’s a heck of an Easter egg, Jessica.
01:31:15	Leonardo Flores:	You’ll see!
01:33:10	Scott Rettberg:	We’ve been putting the recordings up within a couple of hours, Jessica. I missed the start too, but I’ve already watched like three panels I missed — advantage of a virtual conference.
01:34:09	Jessica Pressman:	Yes, I am watching videos too. Grateful for them!
01:34:53	Leonardo Flores:	New computational environments.
01:37:59	Track Four: Conference Admin:	Just a friendly time reminder :)
01:38:18	Mark Sample (he/him):	I’ve always found this post by Nick helpful, re: emulation: https://nickm.com/post/2011/05/emulation-as-game-facsimile-or-computer-edition/
01:38:35	Deena Larsen:	Thank you Matt and Andrew for getting this work out!
01:38:36	Judy Malloy:	Thank you!!
01:38:41	Deena Larsen:	Please have students work on it!
01:38:49	Deena Larsen:	We can send a pdf of the edited notes for a close read!
01:38:52	Susan Tracz:	Thank you to Matthew, Deena and Andrew!  Bill would have appreciated this session!
01:38:55	Nick Montfort (he/him):	Thanks to all of you panelists!
01:39:02	Deena Larsen:	Thank you Soren and Scott!
