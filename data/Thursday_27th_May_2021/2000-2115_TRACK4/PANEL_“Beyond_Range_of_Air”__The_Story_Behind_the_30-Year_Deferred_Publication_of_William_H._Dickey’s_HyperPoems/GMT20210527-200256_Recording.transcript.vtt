1
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.380
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Okay.

2
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:57.630
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Good afternoon, everybody so welcome to this panel on the legacy and recovery of William H Dickies last hyper phones.

3
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:08.760
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: My name is Matthew kirshenbaum i'm a professor of English and digital studies at the University of Maryland and with me today to help narrate this story.

4
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:19.500
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: I have Dana Larsen Andrew fergusson and Susan trace, who I will introduce a little bit more fully and in just a moment but.

5
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:30.900
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: For the next hour and 15 minutes or so, our objective is to tell you a little bit more about who William Hobart Dickey was.

6
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:45.690
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Why his work and, in particular, his work in hyper card is of interest to to this community and the story behind how it came to light after a.

7
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:57.570
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: While depending on how one measures, a 25 or 30 year delay and publication, about which he'll you'll hear more about that too it's a fascinating story that also I think is very.

8
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:16.950
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: instructive for our community at large, so, as I mentioned, and say, as I mentioned, with me, we have first Dr Susan trays, who is a professor.

9
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.950
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: who holds an ma and PhD in English literature, but who teaches graduate statistics and research methods.

10
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:37.680
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: In statistics and measurement at Keller at cal state fresno she's published numerous refereed journal articles has won several teaching awards.

11
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.780
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: and has supervised over 50 doctoral dissertation dissertations and 200 masters over the course of her career.

12
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:58.620
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: particularly notable for us today as well, Dr trace is also William Dickies literary executor and he'll hear again more about that story and relationship in just a moment.

13
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:11.490
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: i'm also with us is Andrew Ferguson, who is currently completing a master's in computer science at the University of Edinburgh I believe exams were just taken.

14
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:22.770
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: On he has also the developer of hyper card online, which is the online and mutilation platform that we use at the Internet archive to present this poetry.

15
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:36.240
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: and Andrew will be talking to us, as you can anticipate about some of the nuts and bolts behind this work and then finally Dana Larsen who needs no particular introduction to this Community.

16
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:47.400
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: So I will not do a lengthy introduction Stewart and i'll throw up, I believe, is fond of introducing dina as a trickster figure and there's something to that, but.

17
00:03:47.760 --> 00:04:02.160
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: I think in ways that you will again hear about shortly, she has a particularly close and meaningful connection to to this particular story so i'm going to begin with just a little bit of context.

18
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:12.660
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: William Dickey y'all hear a little bit more about his life and career from Susan on, but one thing I would just emphasize about dickie.

19
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.930
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Well, perhaps not quite a household name a few few enough poets are nowadays, but did he was a poet.

20
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:38.220
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: with impeccable establishment credentials, it was a Fulbright fellow iowa writers workshop he won in 1958 the yell younger poets award which led to the publication of his first book.

21
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:52.290
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Is competition that year was another poet, you may have heard of named Sylvia Plath, and so a dickie was very much an establishment poet and moved in those circles.

22
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.770
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: He became interested in the creative possibilities for poetry and word processing in the early 1980s.

23
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:13.950
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: The ila community can sometimes be dismissive of me or word processing but dicky grasp the potential for it.

24
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:26.880
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Almost from the moment the technology became popularized and again incorporating it into his writing classes at San Francisco state he spent most of his professional career.

25
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:40.500
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: As a professor of writing at San Francisco state the California association of teachers of English, this is a wonderful honorific they dubbed him a quote friend of the machine.

26
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:58.410
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: so very much an early adopter very much somebody who was visible For those reasons in 1987 he edits a special issue of the New England review and bread love quarterly on computers and writing again a very.

27
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:26.280
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Traditional establishment venue probably the first time, many of its readers had given any serious consideration to the role of computing and digital media and the writing process, so you see Dickies dates on the screen in 1994 he dies in San Francisco of complications from HIV.

28
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:39.030
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: He has survived at the time by his partner and first literary executor named Leonard son as aro who is since deceased i'm.

29
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:57.240
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: about six years prior to his death so around 1998 dickie bought a MacIntosh and specifically a MacIntosh se the system expansion model and he began working on this immediately with hyper card.

30
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:19.830
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: He composed, a total of 14 homes and hyper card before his death to varying states of completion he referred to them as his hyper poems three of them are what we would, I think categorize as erotica they're very explicit very not safe for work.

31
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:41.940
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And they are also, however, unique documents of gay life in San Francisco in the midst of an earlier pandemic i'm so very unique and I think very meaningful to this Community at this particular moment um so a Dickies complete electronic.

32
00:07:41.970 --> 00:08:02.670
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: poems were supposed to have been published by East Gate in 1995 or 1996 and you see here a catalog entry from he stayed at that time, announcing them as forthcoming on likewise in Dickies.

33
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.420
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: posthumous book The education of desire that which appeared from wesleyan university press.

34
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:29.280
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: In also in 1996 if you look at the author's note, you can see sort of I find this fascinating the poems are announced, as already having been published, but they they weren't it didn't happen, for reasons which are.

35
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.570
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: complicated and which perhaps well we'll get into.

36
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:56.280
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: In 2003 four of the poems were published on the CD Rom some of you will, of course, some of you right now i'm sure have this within arm's length for of the poems were published on the CD Rom that was included in the new media reader by Nick Montfort, no, no, but wardrobe fruin.

37
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:15.060
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Interestingly, there is no mention whatsoever of dickie within the printed volumes so it's only the poems on the CD Rom and it's I think safe to say that this particular publication did not result in substantial new exposure for for dickie.

38
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:32.040
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: I would again want to emphasize that his work with hyper card remained largely unknown outside of a small circle of confidence at the time, at the time of his death his his New York Times obituary, for example, made no mention.

39
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.450
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Of the hyper card work.

40
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.540
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: So I come into this particular.

41
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:54.270
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: story um when in 2007 and dina dina Larson gifted what she refers to as the great library of Alexandria for electronic literature, to the University of Maryland where I teach.

42
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:10.920
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And included amongst the components of the great library were two crucial artifacts related to to dickie one is this box of discounts which i'm sure dina recognizes.

43
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:25.890
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: She will, I think, tell you a little bit more about the story proper, but this box of displays where the original discounts that she used to copy files from William Dickies MacIntosh.

44
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:41.490
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Shortly after his death at the behest of Leonard soon as arrow who again what's his first literary executor so to the extent that we talked about originals like an original manuscript and electronic literature.

45
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:52.740
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: These are read these are, these are the first generation files that came directly off of Dickies computers and which now are here at Maryland in this.

46
00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:05.670
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: fujifilm box and they they work, so we have some maps here at Maryland, this is a MAC se, just like dickie would have used, and you can see.

47
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:15.150
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: me executing very poor archival practice here by just i'm happily taking one of those discounts plugging it into the sc 30 and.

48
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:26.310
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: There is the work which is amazing and there's very much something to seeing it on the original screen, the original size hearing the sounds the machine makes.

49
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:37.200
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Of course, to do this, you need to be here at the University of Maryland um the other critical artifact for us is this laptop this.

50
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:50.310
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Book belongs to to dina this is dina's laptop which is now part of our collections here, and it is the laptop So you can see there it is booting up running.

51
00:11:50.850 --> 00:12:09.000
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: ios 9.2 and it is the laptop of that dina used to prepare Dickies poems for their posture in this publication with escape systems, so all the dina's working files from that project.

52
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:17.880
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: live on this laptop and you can see, for example, here's the original cover art, which I believe would have gone on to the.

53
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:29.400
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: sort have been on if you know escapes work, you know those characteristic cardboard sleeves the folio is they publish in I believe this would have been the package artwork, for example.

54
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.830
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: There are the title pages for the two volumes of poetry.

55
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:46.980
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: and so forth, so these were the two resources that working with with dina with Susan and with Andrew.

56
00:12:47.700 --> 00:13:08.430
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: These are the the manuscripts if we will, if you will, the source material that we relied on to eventually upload the poetry, to the Internet archive well lip around back to the conclusion of that story, but at this point i'd like to turn things over to Susan trays who will.

57
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:18.480
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: fill us in a little bit more about Dickies remarkable life and accomplishments so let me turn it over to you Susan.

58
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.340
Susan Tracz: And thank you.

59
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.540
Susan Tracz: My name is Susan grace and I just want to have one.

60
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.190
Susan Tracz: quick.

61
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:39.990
Susan Tracz: correction my master's is in English literature, but my doctorate is actually in statistics and measurement that's how I ended up teaching statistics um let's see it's my screen on here.

62
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.890
Susan Tracz: Let me, let me share my screen i'm not sure if it's.

63
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.440
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Not not yet.

64
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.910
Susan Tracz: Okay.

65
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:05.760
Susan Tracz: Okay.

66
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:15.690
Susan Tracz: There it is yeah so again, my name is Susan trace and the purpose of my presentation here is.

67
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:26.730
Susan Tracz: To provide some background and context into the life of William Dickey and also to explain how a person is unlikely as me came to be William Dickies executor.

68
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.940
Susan Tracz: And now, as many of you know.

69
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:45.420
Susan Tracz: William dickie was a quite an accomplished poet poet, he was the last person chosen by auden is the winner of the Yale younger poets Award for his book of the festivities he wrote 13 books of poetry.

70
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:54.150
Susan Tracz: Not including the works will be discussing today and numerous other works published in compilations and as broadsides.

71
00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:06.630
Susan Tracz: These works include things like leaf lives metamorphosis the Rainbow grocery more under Saturn ribbons of the north rivers of the Northwest.

72
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:25.860
Susan Tracz: The sacrifice consenting joy in the education of desire to name a few of these now some of these were published by private presses, which were really works of art in and of themselves and others were published by quite well known publishing houses, such as well as in.

73
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:40.350
Susan Tracz: Now his poetry was well known to my dear friend Leonard Santa zero and I met Leonard in 1975 when we were both starting our master's degrees in English literature.

74
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:57.150
Susan Tracz: And we were waiting in line to register with our IBM registration cards in hand for those of you who remember those old days and we became fast friends, we knew each other well we knew our mothers Leonard became my son's godfather.

75
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:11.310
Susan Tracz: And my dad used to say that he fell in love, even before he met him because he loved his poetry so much and letter was also a poet, and he was a Sylvia Plath scholar.

76
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:25.530
Susan Tracz: And when he moved to to Reno Nevada to take a lecturer position at the University of Nevada he was much closer to build geographically and eventually he met him at a conference in the courting began.

77
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.810
Susan Tracz: They moved in together in a House on the Hill and willard street your ucsf and San Francisco.

78
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:41.430
Susan Tracz: And bill was a fascinating person it's easy to think of him, just as a poet, but he always spoke in this.

79
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:53.970
Susan Tracz: gentle erudite sophistication of course he was a recognized poet, but he was a sought after professor at San Francisco State University, he was a valued cali.

80
00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:06.930
Susan Tracz: But he also was an accomplished calligrapher here's a picture of his calligraphy some of the work that he did, and he was also an unbelievably fantastic gourmet cook.

81
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:24.510
Susan Tracz: He was an avid shopper who never had as nuff leather jackets and he always had a dog, in fact, he dedicated his book in the dreaming for Len and merlin and Sylvia and merlin wants his core D and, of course, Silvio with Sylvia Plath.

82
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:42.780
Susan Tracz: And when they live together they always published a Christmas card and they sent it out to people at Christmas and included a poem by each of them now, we always spent our Christmases with them, either in San Francisco or in fresno and.

83
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:52.440
Susan Tracz: Here you see bill and Leonard with our son Alex and our daughter Ariel and in the background, you can see the calligraphy.

84
00:17:53.670 --> 00:18:11.760
Susan Tracz: right here, you can see the calligraphy that I showed you earlier in here is one of his early computers and surprisingly, if you if you know what a sophisticated and polished person he was he would still get on the forum play with Alex and our son Alex was um.

85
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:30.540
Susan Tracz: They they really hit it off because Alex was a very fluid reader even at the age of four and they just had a lot in common and so bill eventually used alex's illustrations for his book journey into the night, excuse me on a journey.

86
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:49.050
Susan Tracz: Now, around this time bill became very interested in computers, and this is some pictures of his very first computer which wasn't as born, and this was a very early early computer and bill, I would say what's on the vanguard, he was one of the.

87
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.270
Susan Tracz: Initial people who became very interested in the use of computers.

88
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.410
Susan Tracz: He received grants to work on them.

89
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:07.500
Susan Tracz: And he also became interested in how readers could interact with a poem and how there might be multiple paths through a home.

90
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:16.890
Susan Tracz: And so, he started writing is hyper poems at this time, and this is dina we'll talk more about this later, and incidentally dina may not share this with you.

91
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:28.500
Susan Tracz: But she was a student of bills are he chaired her thesis I believe she finished in 1992 and her thesis have to do with the use of computer technology.

92
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:40.500
Susan Tracz: And how it would change the way we critically look at poetry and other literature and actually I have a letter from bill to dina saying how he would urge her to publish this work.

93
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.270
Susan Tracz: Well, around this time also i'm.

94
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.670
Susan Tracz: Sorry, the next slide.

95
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:56.820
Susan Tracz: here's here's a poem that he wrote computer song on this, this is published and six philosophical songs.

96
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:11.130
Susan Tracz: But, around this time both billing Leonard got tested for AIDS and bill was positive and Leonard was not so they made wills at this time and Leonard may excuse me bill made Leonard is executor.

97
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:26.190
Susan Tracz: A bill then God and was hospitalized for diverticulitis and one of his doctors told her that he thought that treatment was withheld from bill, because he had AIDS, of course, none of this could ever be proven.

98
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:44.340
Susan Tracz: The last time I spoke with bill was on the phone about two weeks before he died in 1994 and he told me that everything would be all right, and he also told me to take care of Leonard because he was always afraid that Leonard would commit suicide.

99
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.100
Susan Tracz: So after.

100
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.040
Susan Tracz: After leonard's passing.

101
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.650
Susan Tracz: There was.

102
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:07.200
Susan Tracz: Work to Leonard really worked on getting the hyper pumps disseminated and he had a contract for their publication.

103
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:21.960
Susan Tracz: In dena did yeoman's work editing these poems but the publication of the publisher never followed through on the contract, although there were multiple multiple multiple attempts to make this contract the.

104
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:32.310
Susan Tracz: follow through on I remember bill worrying about being sued if he sought out another publisher and he kept saying, I have to do something about those poems.

105
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:45.390
Susan Tracz: There was also a correspondence with MIT to have some of these words come out and us on a few of them did but, but not the whole, not the entire catalog of those poems.

106
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.010
Susan Tracz: In.

107
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:56.160
Susan Tracz: 2004 letter did commit suicide, much to the great sadness of all who knew him.

108
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:11.640
Susan Tracz: And when they made their wills Leonard may bill his executor and he named me as the executor in the case that bill passed and so bills literary estate, which had been passed along to Leonard was now passed along to me.

109
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:19.890
Susan Tracz: And being a literary executor sounds romantic but it's actually a lot of work and often a lot of heartache.

110
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:40.050
Susan Tracz: There was getting bills massive oak desk who was God son's mother, the silver back to leonard's fig two bills family some furniture back to surely who was bills ex wife in the archive of bills papers which Leonard had catalog to the library and read can't read college.

111
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:52.560
Susan Tracz: But the problem of the hyper poems was more complicated I consulted with computer X experts at my college California State University fresno about retrieving the poems.

112
00:22:53.190 --> 00:23:03.780
Susan Tracz: And that sort of never was accomplished I started talks with people at San Francisco state about a project to get these poems published but.

113
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:22.020
Susan Tracz: Nothing worked out for one reason or another, so finally when Matthew contacted me with the news and Andrew would be able to make these poems which dina hit edited available on the Internet archive that long held goal of publishing these poems became a reality.

114
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:37.050
Susan Tracz: And, in closing, I have to say that the fact that these poems are fresh and evocative and as relevant today as they were in the early 90s it's really a testimony to William Dickies genius Thank you.

115
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.860
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Thank you so much Susan.

116
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.290
Susan Tracz: most welcome.

117
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.030
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: So we're going to go to Andrew fergusson now.

118
00:23:54.030 --> 00:24:08.550
Andrew Ferguson: Excellent okay i'll just share my screen, I have made things difficult for myself, by doing my slides in hyper card, so any technical issues are entirely my fault.

119
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.590
Andrew Ferguson: let's see.

120
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.730
Andrew Ferguson: Can you see the slide.

121
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.100
Susan Tracz: Yes.

122
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:28.830
Andrew Ferguson: Yes, okay so i'm aware that several people here may not be familiar with hyper card so first of all i'll give a quick introduction to what hyper card is.

123
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:43.170
Andrew Ferguson: It was developed in 1987 by Bill atkinson was working at apple and allowed the authoring of presentations interactive stories databases and software in general.

124
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:53.400
Andrew Ferguson: And collectively a hypercar document is known as a stack so all of these different things, you can do with hyper card or collectively, known as stocks.

125
00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:03.930
Andrew Ferguson: hyper card was initially just treated for free, with every MAC sold, this was a condition that bill atkinson set down when he released it with apple.

126
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:14.190
Andrew Ferguson: So, therefore, there was a very large number of users really into the millions, because every single month that was sold at the time came with a free copy of hyper card.

127
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.500
Andrew Ferguson: So one of the really good things about hyper card is that it's really, really, easy to make stuff in it.

128
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:35.250
Andrew Ferguson: All of the authoring tools were included in the same application as the viewer so these days we've got web browsers and then separate applications for making websites.

129
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:54.870
Andrew Ferguson: But in hyper card you've got the viewer and the author, in the same application, which means it's incredibly easy to inspect other people's stocks see how they did something and then use that in your own stock example of that is here is the this stock and it came with hyper card.

130
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.030
Andrew Ferguson: Not is editable so I.

131
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:04.110
Andrew Ferguson: brought up here there's a window the shoes the code bind one of the buttons on the start included with hyper card.

132
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:22.350
Andrew Ferguson: Unfortunately, all discontinued hypercar in 2000 and for the last updated it and the late 90s, and although there were efforts to make our newer version, they were dropped and apple focus their priorities on other areas.

133
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:32.910
Andrew Ferguson: there's new, modern drop in replacement for hyper card and the are some applications that function in similar ways, or can attempt to read hyper card stocks.

134
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:38.490
Andrew Ferguson: But none of them is a drop in replacement and requires substantial editing on stocks.

135
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:49.740
Andrew Ferguson: So therefore the only way to use hyper card stocks on modern systems is to use an emulator but unfortunately emulators are fairly complicated to set up and get working.

136
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:56.760
Andrew Ferguson: So that brings me to hyper card online and the goal of hyper card ordering are fairly simple.

137
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:11.550
Andrew Ferguson: The first of which is to enable people to run their hyper card stacks on modern systems with new technical experience and, secondly, is to function as a showcase to demonstrate what could be created with hyper card.

138
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.830
Andrew Ferguson: So there's two parts to the system, the first, which is the uploader.

139
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:28.800
Andrew Ferguson: Mrs it here is just a simple web form it allows you to choose a file on your computer that's a stock provide some basic metadata about it and upload it into the archive.

140
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:42.840
Andrew Ferguson: The key thing about the Lunar is that it accepts all formats of stacks the way this works is that i've programmed it to work automatically with the majority of format stocks.

141
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:57.960
Andrew Ferguson: And if it comes across a format that it doesn't recognize it notifies me and I go and manually fix it so that way it can handle a huge variety in stocks, because there was a huge variety in how these stacks were distributed.

142
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.090
Andrew Ferguson: The second part of the system is the archive of stocks, and this is hosted by the Internet archive your nonprofit library in San Francisco.

143
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:22.200
Andrew Ferguson: hyper card online was launched in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of hyper card, and since then over 3500 stocks have been uploaded to the archive.

144
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:41.880
Andrew Ferguson: One key feature of using Internet archive for hosting these stocks is that the Internet archive provide the in browser and religion technology this emulates a MacIntosh plus from 1986 with our own four megabytes of Ram and eight megahertz processor.

145
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:57.900
Andrew Ferguson: directly within your browser the way this works is you can select any stock within the archive it has a play button on the screen, you simply press the play button and this emulator will boot directly within your browser and from there, you can run the staff.

146
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:10.710
Andrew Ferguson: i've got a couple examples here are different stacks now being created with hyper card and that are in the archive just to demonstrate the great variety of things that can be made.

147
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:25.020
Andrew Ferguson: The first of which is a story prompt stack the way this works is it got several pre provided prompts for stories and it gives you a prompt and then it's your job to go and finish the rest of the story.

148
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:31.770
Andrew Ferguson: And it's idea is to help people who maybe want to write a story barn sure how to begin start writing stories.

149
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:47.580
Andrew Ferguson: Second stack is an animation it's very silly little animation about our most under spider running around a computer hyper card was used for making quite a lot of animations and that was another very popular things it was used for.

150
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:59.400
Andrew Ferguson: Another one here is a fairly well known stack called indigo gets and it's a little choose your own adventure game, and you play the role of a cat.

151
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:10.350
Andrew Ferguson: And by clicking different parts of the screen you in the cat wander around the House, you can wander around outside through a tree up trees there's a fun little adventure.

152
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.290
Andrew Ferguson: And finally.

153
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:32.970
Andrew Ferguson: We have here, this was a stack used by a US Defense company to teach internally their employees, about how read our systems worked so hyper card was nice for a huge variety of things, including, of course, this presentation is done in hyper card.

154
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:49.380
Andrew Ferguson: So when you think about getting a hyper card stack from your computer or the original computer into a modern system, there are several challenges, these are both physical challenges and digital challenges.

155
00:30:49.860 --> 00:31:05.280
Andrew Ferguson: If we think about the physical challenges mean one is that moves to the stocks are still on old media, maybe that's floppy disks maybe it's all hard drives maybe zip disks and getting data off these discs is fairly difficult.

156
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:11.400
Andrew Ferguson: Because often they're unreadable or you don't have the modern hardware to read the discs.

157
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:21.060
Andrew Ferguson: An example of this is that all the MAC floppy disks spin at different speeds compared to any other band of computer.

158
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:34.890
Andrew Ferguson: In fact, the speed of the desk changes, depending on the position of the Read head on the desk so as the meathead moves closer into the Center of the disc the disc spins faster and.

159
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:47.850
Andrew Ferguson: New other computer system does this, this was done by apple to save a total of 80 kilobytes of space, so you got an extra 80 kilobits on each floppy disk compared to a windows system.

160
00:31:48.870 --> 00:32:03.510
Andrew Ferguson: For context the email that were sent out for this conference with the link to the zoom links that's 86 kilobytes so it's really a tiny, tiny micro spaces saved but back back then that was a fairly big deal.

161
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.800
Andrew Ferguson: The are thankfully modern solutions to this i've got two pictures of them here.

162
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:20.070
Andrew Ferguson: On top we have here a board called a flux engine down below is a grease weasel these act like intelligent controllers.

163
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:27.810
Andrew Ferguson: Allowing you to connect a regular floppy drive to them and on the other side, you have a USB connection to a modern computer.

164
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:33.600
Andrew Ferguson: And that allows you to read these more exotic this format on a modern system.

165
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:52.680
Andrew Ferguson: And for the hyper poems we're fairly lucky to have them on on bi book, which is booth old enough to be able to have the hyper stacks on them, but modern enough to have USB and basic Internet connectivity so that was very good in this case.

166
00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:08.550
Andrew Ferguson: Now, once you've got the data off the old medium The second challenge or the digital towns and that's getting the data into a form that can be interpreted by modern systems are the hypercar stack.

167
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.330
Andrew Ferguson: And so that first of all involved converting it to a stack more importantly, not it's.

168
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:26.010
Andrew Ferguson: awesome modern system is today will change in 10 years time because computers are continuously evolving so it's very important to make sure that things like.

169
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:35.790
Andrew Ferguson: Data loss and data, corruption, now I guarded against otherwise you may lose the stack and all the work you've put into recovering it off the physical media.

170
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:48.210
Andrew Ferguson: An example of this is a very strange way that old MAC systems handle files and every old MAC store is a file in two parts.

171
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:54.600
Andrew Ferguson: One for the data, called the data fork and one for the resources, called the resource for.

172
00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:03.780
Andrew Ferguson: Modern operating systems don't understand this at all for a modern operating system, everything is just data not resources.

173
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:12.660
Andrew Ferguson: And therefore it's very easy for the data fork and the resource board come separated and subsequently the source port to be lost.

174
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:23.760
Andrew Ferguson: This is a problem because hyper card uses the resource forks to store icons sounds and some codes and, therefore, if the resource for is missing.

175
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:36.960
Andrew Ferguson: Then the stack won't play properly, this is an issue we had with the hyper phones, the first time we transfer them the resource work was missing and as a result, the stones weren't working correctly.

176
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:52.560
Andrew Ferguson: The best way to handle this is to transfer the stocks and really counts for any MAC MAC files is to use a format, the stores booth resorts fork and the data for in a single file.

177
00:34:53.040 --> 00:35:05.670
Andrew Ferguson: And if you've used all MAC systems, the software means of stuff at expand not binary and been hacks maybe familiar Those are all the format that you want to use to transfer the stacks correctly.

178
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:16.920
Andrew Ferguson: And of course my emulator has crashed I knew there'd be issues okay.

179
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:34.320
Andrew Ferguson: Second, of all another issue can have is data loss and I knew this personally as back in March, the company, I was using to host the uploader suffered a major fire other data Center and consequently.

180
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:48.840
Andrew Ferguson: The all the servers were destroyed and I didn't have a backup of the code or used for the router so it took me quite a while to get things to work again but thankfully I managed to get it working just earlier this week.

181
00:35:51.930 --> 00:36:01.140
Andrew Ferguson: So, in summary, the main points I have is that there's a large archive of stocks available that can be viewed directly within the browser.

182
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:11.310
Andrew Ferguson: there any need for installing software or configuring anything technical you can do that archive.org forward slash details forward slash hyper card stocks.

183
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:24.300
Andrew Ferguson: You can also lose your own stocks, the uploader is that hyper card online tk and, as I mentioned earlier, it accepts really any format of hyper card stock and it should be able to work with that.

184
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:38.100
Andrew Ferguson: And if you have any questions if you've got any stacks of your own or know someone that has, please let me know I I love assisting people are getting their stocks on to the archive my email addresses on the screen there i'm on Twitter as well.

185
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.870
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Thank you, Andrew.

186
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:55.620
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: I think, Nick Montfort is in the room, I think my my first extended conversation with Nick was in an airport in Santa Barbara and we were talking about a hyper this was.

187
00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:05.520
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: About 20 years ago talking about a hyper card emulator and neither of us over did it, but here we are, so thank you Andrew.

188
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:12.420
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Last, we have Dana Larsen and dina I believe it's going to.

189
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.260
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: read some.

190
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.520
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: poetry for us.

191
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:15.900
dina.

192
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.660
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And you're you're muted dina.

193
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:41.910
Deena Larsen: Okay, let me unmute first and then let me share my screen and since i'm very lucky to have three monitors, I have an incredible system now i'm just so nice.

194
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.990
Deena Larsen: Let me know what screen i'm seeing do you guys see as an Ob acquainted Camara.

195
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.610
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Yes, yes, we do.

196
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.610
Deena Larsen: Okay, I first wanted to show.

197
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:54.930
Deena Larsen: Some.

198
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:06.210
Deena Larsen: yeah here does okay So the first thing I wanted to show was how you get into it, this is the emulator that Andrew has some beautifully suggested, and it does have all of the poems.

199
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:13.290
Deena Larsen: The one I wanted to read was the one that bill and I work read together.

200
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:24.300
Deena Larsen: When I was doing my master's thesis at the University of Colorado in 1989 90 I interviewed everybody in the field Stewart.

201
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:37.710
Deena Larsen: we're in vicki has some student actually zach and we should have his desktop as well, I had stolen them so they should be on that file will find those and.

202
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:55.590
Deena Larsen: bill was an incredible thesis advisor he did it all for free, for me, I don't think he ever got any credit, but he was my true thesis advisor when I was writing marble springs, which is a hyper card stack and I got to meet him in person once.

203
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.180
Deena Larsen: And Leonard and bill and I had a wonderful afternoon.

204
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.440
Deena Larsen: And then I will go through his poems here.

205
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.060
Deena Larsen: But this is the one that means a lot to me because we did read it together.

206
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.300
Deena Larsen: Let me see.

207
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:18.540
Deena Larsen: Which screen I use that are using this to novia that is somehow not working out.

208
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.640
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Yes, now we are good enough.

209
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.600
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: A season.

210
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:26.880
Deena Larsen: I am but it's not working at the moment, so let me try again.

211
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:32.190
Deena Larsen: Okay cool.

212
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.250
Deena Larsen: going to work now.

213
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.520
Deena Larsen: going to work now.

214
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:51.390
Deena Larsen: One of the I want to read this middle talk about it, but one of the issues here is that bill was very interested in mystique navigation so.

215
00:39:52.260 --> 00:40:12.780
Deena Larsen: What they did was to hide the navigation bars, which is really fun what he wants to do and I will do this in two voices is read the poem and then play the game, so the matches store after my dead child met his own image walking in the garden that apparition soul of men, he saw.

216
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.180
Deena Larsen: not going to sit there on the.

217
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:28.380
Deena Larsen: Left left hand holding the right stabs when the days centers yeah we're not going to get anywhere stabbing but it's off Center.

218
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.360
Deena Larsen: Was power skeleton and remembers not the brain.

219
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:54.810
Deena Larsen: And here, you see an interface, this is part of hyper card, where you could go and program something random says a bit odd the city generates from the paradigms of anger no its darkness it's anger.

220
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.330
Deena Larsen: anger of the defeated of the victor for the humiliation of sharing.

221
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.810
Deena Larsen: Thank you, is there, but no he's in the corner.

222
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:16.290
Deena Larsen: A cast about in the dark after the enemy it's not the dark the counts it's the old days.

223
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:26.040
Deena Larsen: Where the power gathers the drip of honey nope not her she's being held it's her.

224
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:33.120
Deena Larsen: increments her musical glass heart, and of course it's the one that stands.

225
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:41.220
Deena Larsen: The revenge of the darkness on the wind landward this poor guy.

226
00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:53.340
Deena Larsen: We see the visual repetition, which is very important in.

227
00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:00.240
Deena Larsen: blindness brings it from multiple to one and the destitution of beginning.

228
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.610
Deena Larsen: And he is blind.

229
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:17.970
Deena Larsen: and Andrew yeah we are getting this a little bit too slow, but it's fine recognizing and electric dimension, having Brett link fire.

230
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.850
Deena Larsen: it's not the dimensions it's the.

231
00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:28.920
Deena Larsen: silver horizon to the pool of mirror into which the swallow dips and vanishes it is.

232
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:39.360
Deena Larsen: pages of the spread book confessing to one another, and these images will also appear in accomplished night.

233
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.550
Deena Larsen: It is not the mouse it's the growth.

234
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:53.100
Deena Larsen: Fresh under the mask stringency, we have to go again.

235
00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.710
Deena Larsen: Welcoming the slight wind on the cusp of winter it's not.

236
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.930
Deena Larsen: it's not there on by the way, there are more than one button.

237
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:20.460
Deena Larsen: Under the stone breaking it open within the stone seating it's crystal hearts nope it's not in the crystal heart itself it's in the flower.

238
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:28.830
Deena Larsen: The city generates for the paradigms of anger power, but the power animates the lines edge in the mouth.

239
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:40.500
Deena Larsen: coming together the I the orbit but the I doesn't do anything for us it's the orbits.

240
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.730
Deena Larsen: Are there are the eyes in the interest ISIS, which is so important here.

241
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.290
Deena Larsen: And again, you get the repetition, this is very much like a jam session.

242
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.110
Deena Larsen: Of these types of repetitions.

243
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:56.940
Deena Larsen: and

244
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:05.490
Deena Larsen: yeah I think we're a little slow but it's okay it's also the zoom so it's tech it's.

245
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.980
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Everything else extravagant.

246
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:09.540
Deena Larsen: devil yeah.

247
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:17.160
Deena Larsen: fountains of layoffs sky of the punch away says.

248
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.690
Deena Larsen: Is constellations of mercy.

249
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.300
Deena Larsen: In the not in the.

250
00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.020
Deena Larsen: memory space, and this is a random.

251
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:49.800
Deena Larsen: memory of the wide space of sky and Leonard and I designed this page because there actually wasn't a call have fun and Leonard want to call it fun, so we provided them.

252
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.250
Deena Larsen: did take us a while to figure out where things were from.

253
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.130
Deena Larsen: But, given all of that, now that you've seen one of the works.

254
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:08.700
Deena Larsen: I wasn't going to tell the story, but i'm going to now because you guys introduced it so basically what happened was we work together we we corresponded.

255
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:20.520
Deena Larsen: Leonard was William was one of the ones who talked about marble springs and reviewed it for each gate and I get to San Francisco after.

256
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:43.020
Deena Larsen: Wednesday and I just wanted to hug Leonard and say hey i'm it's okay and Leonard opens the door and he says, oh you're here to edit the work and i'm like oh yeah yeah that would be cool man oh my God, it is a MAC quadro do you load this thing had one entire gig of Ram it was so cool.

257
00:45:44.040 --> 00:46:01.410
Deena Larsen: wow I got to touch this computer it was amazing and so he leaves me in here I get into this room and there's a computer with nothing say or nothing in order Okay, here we go um and editing it was really interesting.

258
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:21.600
Deena Larsen: So how do you edit hypertext and new media when both the writer and the program have cat past and enter yeah hyper card might have been around till 1998 but in 1994 it was pretty much still a dead work, it was very difficult to get.

259
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:37.470
Deena Larsen: um so we have this computer and, by the way, so I go through this you'll see the screenshots of some of William depicts work and you'll see where it came from, and we are not sure what dates, these are so I have to say flourish.

260
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:48.360
Deena Larsen: But how do you confront the computer that remains, how do you walk into a place, how do you determine what dickie wanted what bill wanted what were these finished with a not.

261
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:56.580
Deena Larsen: We just declared everything finished, which was an interesting choice because you'll see some of the poems are rougher than others.

262
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:07.800
Deena Larsen: um what order, we had no idea what order, we were going to choose, so we finally said well let's make it a circle, so that there is no true order.

263
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:17.340
Deena Larsen: And the circle is based on actually content and how we saw that these works were working in terms of navigational structure.

264
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:30.210
Deena Larsen: They are also very much based on not safe for work and safe for work volume two is the erotica asked me later about the stories here and the faces i'm not going to talk about it now.

265
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:43.860
Deena Larsen: How do you determine if something's a bug or a feature, for example in when I watched bill do the novia Queen of palmyra palmyra.

266
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:52.140
Deena Larsen: He clicked on certain things, and they worked many clicked on one of those oh it didn't work oh I gotta go back and fix that will never did go back and fix it.

267
00:47:52.500 --> 00:48:11.040
Deena Larsen: But I happen to know, because we read it together that it was supposed to work, what am I supposed to I don't remember where it was supposed to go I yeah so Susan has and can wave this wonderful print page by page.

268
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:26.790
Deena Larsen: notebook of where I took every page and when okay here are the buttons that work here, the ones that don't what do we do, and every editorial decision is in that book and I thought that was last for years until today, so thank you Susan for saving that.

269
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.330
Deena Larsen: So we do have that at least archival notebook.

270
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:49.470
Deena Larsen: I did cheat as Andrew was saying it is really easy to cheat in hypercar you can look up everything unfortunately there was programming behind each of these buttons and some of that code didn't work there were programs behind the images, it was painful.

271
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:59.370
Deena Larsen: You have sound and slide transitions as you saw into novia, how do you resurrect that when hypercar dies.

272
00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.790
Deena Larsen: And you have these invisible buttons which she was really as you saw they are really integral to the work.

273
00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:23.550
Deena Larsen: How do you create that we were thinking we could do it on flash rob swaggered and I were really wondering how we could do this and we got together a couple of times and we tried to resurrect one of these on flash and we gave up, it was just too overwhelming a task.

274
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:34.410
Deena Larsen: How to deal with random elements hyper card was incredible you could place a random element script in anything and go places it was amazing.

275
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:35.850
Deena Larsen: um.

276
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.620
Deena Larsen: So yeah it fell through the cracks um.

277
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:48.570
Deena Larsen: This was a daunting task on a personal note Susan when you called me in because you actually finally found my number.

278
00:49:49.380 --> 00:50:07.020
Deena Larsen: I had just collapsed and was just learning how to deal with a wheelchair, and I was like yeah i'm going to get with you and didn't so my illness my job interfered every time I thought about this project, it was.

279
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:14.520
Deena Larsen: It was so overwhelming I couldn't do it, and I wanted to so badly then.

280
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:29.430
Deena Larsen: It got pushed to the back of everything else, and it shouldn't.

281
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.100
Deena Larsen: So.

282
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:43.980
Deena Larsen: I wanted to say, here are some lessons learned for everybody listening for god's sake, take a copy of this page give it to every.

283
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:53.370
Deena Larsen: writer, you know for pete fake never ever let this happen to anybody else, please no oh my God.

284
00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:00.990
Deena Larsen: i'm okay first thing today go through your computer, will you mind just getting a folder that says finished work.

285
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:15.480
Deena Larsen: If nothing else, label what you've got archive you should please designate the literary executors and talk to them ahead of time don't just surprise them like we surprises and say hey this is what's going on.

286
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:22.620
Deena Larsen: My personal will I have five literary executors name that I believe i've talked to them all.

287
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:32.340
Deena Larsen: yeah and write your damn Meta notes, if nothing else, spend an afternoon with a with a recorder going zoom and record yourself and do something.

288
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:45.360
Deena Larsen: and say this is what I met this is why I use this platform, we all work to the software God sake tell us what you wanted to do don't make me to make us read your mind so.

289
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.660
Deena Larsen: Thank you for being rescued matt has already shared the.

290
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.670
Deena Larsen: The URLs go through these works, they are amazing.

291
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:08.460
Deena Larsen: The simulations I think that was the best solution, particularly for dickie because he stays closer to the original intense they are available online.

292
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:20.850
Deena Larsen: And that's pretty much what I wanted to say, I met, one of the make sure there was time for some questions and, if you like, matt either way you want to do this, I can continue sharing some.

293
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:28.500
Deena Larsen: Of the gorgeous work here, as we talk, or we can go back to seeing each other's faces whatever you'd like to do.

294
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:39.480
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: um I guess i'm in favor of faces for the conversational heart um I did want to.

295
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:53.610
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: just very briefly as a little kind of quota just to contribute another small bit of the poetry I don't have.

296
00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.680
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: I don't have screenshots the way you do DNA, but I did want to.

297
00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:06.030
Deena Larsen: Stop sharing my screen oh good review viewing you're great.

298
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:19.530
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: you're a good i'm dickie as I think you mentioned dina he was fascinated his whole life by by loops by patterns by repetition and recurrences by mandela's.

299
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:29.880
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And I came across some of you may have noticed the the title for this session beyond range of there, and this is from the hyper pound volcano.

300
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:46.050
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: there's a sense in which to me anyway in my reading it does seem to sort of anticipate this this moment today, right now, even though it was written 30 years ago, so I I just thought I would read it before we have discussion.

301
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:59.640
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: This is my letter to you what I had not thought to say, but to fold as we fold away the evening or the butterflies carefully in the pattern of stiff record.

302
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:11.070
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: creasing it making the fold slice sharpened exact that are only meant to crumble and break from their own weight years later, when the person is up and.

303
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:26.040
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: When What is left is a breath of voice rising transparently, the logic behind the perfume all of what once was sense stinking a little at range beyond range of air.

304
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:37.470
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And so, with that we have time for people's questions.

305
00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.360
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: discussion.

306
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:54.480
Susan Tracz: No, I just want to make one comment, and that is, I think there's some somewhat of a sense of loss that it's been such a long time in getting bills or out, but I think we could reframe this to think of it as.

307
00:54:55.530 --> 00:55:07.350
Susan Tracz: Maybe this work was safe for us in in waiting so long there's there's a certain increased appreciation of it so maybe this is the perfect time and maybe.

308
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:17.850
Susan Tracz: Despite all our efforts and work for so many years and trying to get it published maybe this is exactly perfect exactly the way it's supposed to be.

309
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:29.670
Susan Tracz: I think now we've added other I think it can reach a broader audience more easily now than it could be when obviously when this was first written.

310
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:38.280
Deena Larsen: Oh Susan you're absolutely right Thank you so much for reframing that and reframing my life and my guilty at this point, but yes.

311
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:45.750
Deena Larsen: That is a problem and and john can talk to this too, with uncle bobby's one house with marble springs with Jim rosenberg instagrams.

312
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:54.450
Deena Larsen: We had the work, but we did not have the audience at the time in 1990s, for example, just real briefly.

313
00:55:54.990 --> 00:56:05.010
Deena Larsen: The reason why William Dickey became My thesis advisor was because my real thesis advisors at my real university did not know how to use a mouse.

314
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:11.730
Deena Larsen: I had to put previous and next version buttons in because they could not understand links.

315
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:24.510
Deena Larsen: And William vicki was the only one who got my thesis together because he got it he understood, where we were going there were very few of us, I interviewed everybody in the field, all eight of them, including chuck.

316
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:31.950
Deena Larsen: and Judy I think at the time to remember yeah and so.

317
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.990
Deena Larsen: you're right we didn't have the audience we just had 10 people, maybe.

318
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:49.560
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Questions that people may have things folks want to know more about.

319
00:56:52.500 --> 00:57:03.150
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And I jic James Ryan, but I think we're we're a small enough group so you know feel free to just unmute yourself and pose your your question or your comment.

320
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:12.060
James Ryan: I, I have to leave right now, and so sorry to been to the front of the line that was so amazing this is such a fantastic session.

321
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:20.130
James Ryan: I want to show a peculiar artifact for a moment, which is a print version of volcano the hyper palm that matches read from.

322
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:25.620
James Ryan: i've identified one other copy in existence, I found this for 20 bucks on a used book site.

323
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:31.950
James Ryan: And what it is, is a printed out version of the Let me try to show it here it's a vertical orientation.

324
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:42.570
James Ryan: or horizontal rather it's a printed out version of the stack and I haven't done a detailed analysis analysis of this that's on my to do list and i'll be documenting this and scanning it and so forth.

325
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:55.890
James Ryan: But a strange really interesting artifact of the intersection of print and very digital work, I do have to run, I just want to say thank you again and keep your eyes peeled on Twitter or something for me to release this game all right.

326
00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.180
Deena Larsen: Oh yeah.

327
00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:01.740
Deena Larsen: Let her talk about that he didn't have one I don't think Susan Leonard didn't have that.

328
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.510
Susan Tracz: And I know I.

329
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.680
James Ryan: lost his yeah okay so.

330
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:13.620
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: going to be DMA James for his home address and.

331
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.380
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Times out of the House.

332
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:17.910
James Ryan: yeah.

333
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.520
James Ryan: To do right.

334
00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.240
James Ryan: I thought identified one other copy.

335
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:25.440
Deena Larsen: This has.

336
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:28.560
James Ryan: The markings of the author prettiness copy.

337
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:37.260
James Ryan: Perhaps it was the only one in maybe I somehow came to require the one that I saw identified online it's not enrolled.

338
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.050
James Ryan: oclc it was in the holdings.

339
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.740
James Ryan: Which is inside sonics press on it.

340
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:46.500
James Ryan: there's no identification of a press.

341
00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:55.650
James Ryan: The call often volcano is a hydrophone designed by William dickie in San Francisco and October 1988 is copyright bites after.

342
00:58:56.010 --> 00:59:07.110
James Ryan: clip art is taken from the collection of ends in post review me in the icons are from the icon factory, the type they seized upon the Chicago perhaps that's the same call from that would be in there and like record.

343
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:13.470
Deena Larsen: it's not it's not Leonard and I had to recreate the qualified from memory i'm sure it's our call upon is wrong.

344
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.750
James Ryan: Okay well um.

345
00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:30.330
James Ryan: wow he's anyone reached out to them easy enough to find i'm so sorry I really have to go to this next one, so that's a good tease I guess and i'm definitely hoping to document this and get this artifact thanks again wow what a fun session.

346
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:31.560
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: goodbye thank.

347
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:33.150
Susan Tracz: You so much.

348
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:45.990
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: yeah I mean one one fascinating thing was that dickie was very much involved in the sort of small press and chop book world.

349
00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:57.570
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: He actually he went to I think it was mentioned, he went to read college, as did somebody named Steve Jobs so there's there's another one of those non dollar like patterns there.

350
00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:09.900
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: But i'm at read he studied calligraphy he also studied about our press printing as Steve Jobs himself did and there's a lot of sort of overlap between.

351
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:32.730
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: dickie and the claims of one offs and chapbooks that he was producing and the the letterpress and find printing world so, on the one hand connections into to email it but also deep 10 drills into another claimed of writing technology as well, specifically letterpress printing.

352
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:43.200
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Judy and again folks can just unmute themselves and jump right in.

353
01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.680
Susan Tracz: Judy are muted.

354
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.730
Judy Malloy: There can you hear me now.

355
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:07.590
Judy Malloy: yep good, I just want to know that in California.

356
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:29.340
Judy Malloy: There was a little bit more of an audience that it sounds like there is wasn't other parts of the country, I think it was partially because of the well i'm both on our column on the well, but the wellhead other parts to it, there was an art conference on the well actually I started and.

357
01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:43.860
Judy Malloy: So, and it was more connection with the tech community in California i'm talking about the bay area and of southern California, which I didn't know about um so there was a lot of exhibitions.

358
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:55.530
Judy Malloy: of works on hyper card, it was more familiarity with what everybody was doing on there was a bit more buzz and I I i'm pretty sure I saw some tick.

359
01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:15.150
Judy Malloy: A work of Dickies that I don't see anything that looks like and what i've seen so far, and it was more of a textual work with circles alliances that and the hyper textual links within the page itself that were less graphic diffuse does that ring a bell anyone.

360
01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.020
Deena Larsen: Possibly hair say.

361
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:21.690
Judy Malloy: Okay.

362
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:24.450
Deena Larsen: i'm not sure, though.

363
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:34.260
Judy Malloy: But his work, even despite that, I know that say at the revealing conversations exhibition in 1989.

364
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:44.400
Judy Malloy: which included every dawn's hyper card work and my name was no pay and lyndhurst MINS lorna work and divorce wilson's work from.

365
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:56.430
Judy Malloy: San Francisco state vicki was not included in that exhibition I don't know why, and there were some other things that his work wasn't included in so I don't know if he.

366
01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:08.310
Judy Malloy: Perhaps being a tour poet, is, I will say um he wasn't as involved in the you know visual arts aspect I don't know.

367
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:20.280
Judy Malloy: But I do know that to go back to the beginning that that his name was known and that there was a certain amount of buzz much more than 10 people.

368
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:34.680
Deena Larsen: yeah it was difficult for me, because I was like alone, but he also taught because he had he had a work from a student James neff and some other student work that I think was still on that desk yeah.

369
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:36.690
Deena Larsen: And I grabbed.

370
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.130
Susan Tracz: In the bay area and his readings were.

371
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:57.390
Susan Tracz: always well well attended, you know, following because he had taught for years and years at San Francisco State University and mentored many poets, and you know winter bread loaf and places like that and.

372
01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.900
Susan Tracz: But he did go through a phase where he.

373
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.400
Susan Tracz: kind of didn't like so work of.

374
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.570
Susan Tracz: chasing publications and their whole aspect of writing.

375
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:32.430
Richard Holeton: So, speaking of San Francisco state and in the spirit of sharing a personal remembrances first Thank you so much for this presentation is really wonderful.

376
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:49.020
Richard Holeton: So I did my masters at San Francisco state in the 1980s when bill was there, of course, and and I did meet him, but I didn't have classes with him, because I was doing fiction.

377
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:59.610
Richard Holeton: But it's very aware of bill, and what he was doing, and as I got into the whole computers and writing scene.

378
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:18.450
Richard Holeton: San Francisco State did not have an MFA that time, so they created an MFA in the 90s and bill was still there, and so I came back and said Oh well, now you have an MFA i'm going to do an MFA but i'm going to do an electronic thing and.

379
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:33.000
Richard Holeton: i'm going to do a hypertext thing and so naturally bill was the was would be the guy because he was the only one there doing that kind of thing, so I had arranged with him to be my advisor.

380
01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:47.370
Richard Holeton: And I started back into that MFA program and 93 and then, of course, unfortunately bill passed away and I had to make other plans there with my MFA.

381
01:05:53.370 --> 01:06:08.730
Deena Larsen: yeah again I was somewhat out of the loop, it was I was just a student and I wish I had known about rob and I wish I could talk to you more about a Judy there's just so much that was going on at the time to that, and it was also very.

382
01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.830
Deena Larsen: disconnected.

383
01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:17.970
Deena Larsen: It was tough um and I know bill and I talked about it a little bit thinking.

384
01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:27.660
Deena Larsen: It was one of those how many people will get it, how many people can do have the computer literacy, but thank you yeah.

385
01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:33.630
Deena Larsen: And it's so interesting to see all the pieces come together 2530 years later.

386
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.200
Susan Tracz: Definitely was a person who was ahead of his time.

387
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:50.640
Deena Larsen: Yes, and Nick is here as well, with an can possibly shed some light on the new media reader as I recall mick um.

388
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:55.050
Deena Larsen: It was relatively difficult to get those dickie poems and I.

389
01:06:56.130 --> 01:07:04.200
Deena Larsen: As I call the reason why you could not talk about them was we got that permission relatively late in the game.

390
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.080
Nick Montfort (he/him): I don't know that there was.

391
01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.210
Nick Montfort (he/him): Like a real restriction about talking about the poem so much.

392
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:19.830
Nick Montfort (he/him): You know, we, I mean we will love to publish all of Dickies work.

393
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:36.420
Nick Montfort (he/him): Getting a selection was better than not having any of it, and so you know it seemed like what was suitable for the publisher was that we'd have a selection option might be kept it open, for you know, being able to.

394
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:46.170
Nick Montfort (he/him): monetize the publication of the whole collection later on, so that was, you know that was what we did.

395
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:54.600
Nick Montfort (he/him): And, and it worked out all right, of course, the actual actually being able to.

396
01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.280
Nick Montfort (he/him): Access those those hyper card stacks I mean it was.

397
01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:09.960
Nick Montfort (he/him): You know, strictly speaking, technically, it was possible for some people in 2001 when the new media reader was published but access to that.

398
01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:22.110
Nick Montfort (he/him): Was diminished, I mean, as I feel in many ways, like Ted Nelson says about this it's not hypercar didn't die right, it still works it's just that our computers.

399
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:34.470
Nick Montfort (he/him): That we use like the computer i'm using now to video conference with everyone else, well, first of all it's not a MAC but even if I were that you know if I were using a MAC it wouldn't run hyper card you.

400
01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:41.040
Nick Montfort (he/him): know so you know the, the issue is that we expect these things to work on.

401
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:50.970
Nick Montfort (he/him): Our everyday computers and obviously that's not the case, but as far as it, so I mean actually those those four problems are still in print.

402
01:08:51.240 --> 01:09:03.480
Nick Montfort (he/him): Because the new meter reader is still in print and it comes with that same CD Rom that it was originally you know published with, and so you can buy that from MIT press, and you can get your.

403
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.220
Nick Montfort (he/him): Physical optical disc copy of those four poems by dickie, if you like.

404
01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:12.120
well.

405
01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:15.720
Nick Montfort (he/him): what's that.

406
01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:17.610
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: I thought it was a coaster.

407
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.260
Nick Montfort (he/him): yeah.

408
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.320
Nick Montfort (he/him): By enough of them, you can make a chandelier.

409
01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:43.320
Deena Larsen: And if you take the zip drive and you put it to the back of an SE se, you can actually run it it's pretty cool that the technology, I still have, I think I haven't tried them for a few years, but in my attic I think I still have about 20 of the 215 MAC SES and MAC and and.

410
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:55.530
Deena Larsen: Not classics that I got from the Denver public school system and an auction bid and kept putting them up, I made sure that they worked and i've given those to archives and to other places.

411
01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:07.530
Deena Larsen: Just to show Dickies work Jim Jim rosenbergs uncle buddy funhouse my marble springs, there were so many incredible works on hypercar I.

412
01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:21.510
Nick Montfort (he/him): mean, of course, you know, I have a facility, the truck tank in which you know I present classic computers of various sorts, and yet, to some extent it's a little bit like having.

413
01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.350
Nick Montfort (he/him): You know the the.

414
01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.490
Nick Montfort (he/him): auto parts lot.

415
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:40.170
Nick Montfort (he/him): where you have to you know, like as you go along and time you have to you know go to computers pull things out of them and repair things, and you know, try to keep things working.

416
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:56.910
Nick Montfort (he/him): There are standard processes like you know, replacing the capacitors like recapping machines, you know things like this that you can do, and I think that's a do it, you know I mean I don't actually I don't touch the hardware I don't use a soldering iron, but I try to maintain these.

417
01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:03.570
Nick Montfort (he/him): means have access to the hardware, along with it, you know I also use.

418
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:14.220
Nick Montfort (he/him): emulators and you know modern day interpreters for these systems, and I think that's great too, I really think of these sort of different editions.

419
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:30.930
Nick Montfort (he/him): of a computer, so you know what's provided on the Internet archive for you to access hypertext from my standpoint, for you to access hypercar it's just a different edition of the MacIntosh se you know it's an it's an unofficial edition and it's not a hardware addition, in the same way.

420
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:44.490
Nick Montfort (he/him): But it has many advantages that the hardware edition doesn't and on the other hand, if you want people to see what the hardware edition was like and to actually have you interactive experience in dealing with that.

421
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:55.410
Nick Montfort (he/him): Then you would like to present them with that as well, so I you know so from my standpoint, I wish to do these things, some people will say oh it's a you know.

422
01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:03.810
Nick Montfort (he/him): it's a losing battle, why do you have this hardware and so forth, and again, you can there's plenty of responses to that also which is like.

423
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:13.770
Nick Montfort (he/him): You know why do you take your students to go see a play it's going to close in a week it's like Oh, you might as well take advantage of the stuff that's there, right now, you know you might as well do it.

424
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:24.360
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: yeah well we're getting called on time and I just want to thank you and I just want to say a couple of thank yous but before we all break.

425
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:31.650
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: One thing I do want to say true is that this this work is now out there it's part of our.

426
01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:45.780
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Community and I just really want to encourage everyone is here today to share it if you have students, you might suggest they they work on it, I think there is there there's a lot of.

427
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:56.550
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: it's really rich and there's a there is a lot that we can do here and just tweeting the URL is great, but in and of itself that's not enough.

428
01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:58.470
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: So that's.

429
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:11.730
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: One one comment, and then I do want to thank, I want to thank Sarin and Scott redbird and all of the the conference organizers for the the venue and the occasion.

430
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:23.940
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: And all of the virtual work behind the scenes from our student assistance, thank you for the for the platform today and I especially I want to thank.

431
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:43.920
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: Susan dina and and Andrew I am really the the least a central part of this up a ratio and i'm just the coordinator, but each of them really contributed and valuable Labor, without which we wouldn't have this work today, so thank you so much, everybody.

432
01:13:44.760 --> 01:14:00.090
Deena Larsen: Thank you so much, and we can continue this on the tracks and discord and I am having a private, public celebration today on discord after this, so we can continue this conversation Thank you guys so much.

433
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.460
Judy Malloy: For card that are should be out that aren't and I.

434
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:11.790
Judy Malloy: Work that i'm going to try to find intended.

435
01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:14.520
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: So Judy you should talk to an.

436
01:14:15.570 --> 01:14:26.610
Judy Malloy: angel yes, I didn't have a MAC I had to they let me go over to the whole earth review offices actually what hyper card came out and try it.

437
01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:38.910
Judy Malloy: And I created a work, then I use a scanner which i'd never use it came from apple and I could not edited at home didn't have a MAC but I use the one of my old card catalogs.

438
01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:46.350
Judy Malloy: and made the work from a card catalog using the images in the text, and it was actually pretty good but i'm just vanilla look at it.

439
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.290
Deena Larsen: yeah.

440
01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.070
I agree.

441
01:14:51.360 --> 01:15:05.070
Deena Larsen: I couldn't afford a MAC and I had the reason why I did marble springs is My thesis was because of the math lab have Max and I could use them, I mean my God a MacIntosh was like a month pay it was.

442
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.000
A lot of money.

443
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:12.060
Judy Malloy: yeah I was a single parent, I could not afford a MacIntosh.

444
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.000
Deena Larsen: And William Dickies bill setup was.

445
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:23.160
Deena Larsen: i'm still lusting after it, I still wanted.

446
01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.120
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum: A MAC i'm.

447
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:27.720

475
01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:05.970
Deena Larsen: i've worked now for 30 years for the government i've been at their beck and call yes or no, Sir everything else as a technical writer, and now I have health insurance for the rest of my life.

476
01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:19.200
Deena Larsen: And I can do whatever I want i'm still at the government for right now until I decide what my second career is, but after 30 years i'm free to write so it's going to so we're celebrating.

477
01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:21.510
Susan Tracz: Congratulations.

478
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:31.500
Deena Larsen: that's good um I went into the government, instead of academia deliberately just because I have a rare disease and Susan you know yeah it was really bad.

479
01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.670
Deena Larsen: Without health insurance i'd be dead in about two to five months.

480
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:40.620
Deena Larsen: So it's really important that I get this and.

481
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:42.120
Thank you for understanding.

482
01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:47.340
Deena Larsen: yeah and I know I keep disappearing because of illness and.
