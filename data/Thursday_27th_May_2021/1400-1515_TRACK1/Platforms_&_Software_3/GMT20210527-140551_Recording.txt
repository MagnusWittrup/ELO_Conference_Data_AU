00:25:40	Mark Marino:	dene grigar is using The Next for a preservation effort
00:26:36	Samara Hayley Steele:	Fixed it! The paper should be visible now
00:26:47	Zach Whalen (He|Him):	Thanks!
00:44:51	Erika Fulop:	Could the Observable and the LAOB project be a tool/space for this too? GitHub more open/flexible in some way?
00:45:23	Erika Fulop:	(Or since a lot of projects are already on GitHub it’s better to Start there?)
00:47:04	Erika Fulop:	(Amazing project in any case, fab idea!)
00:47:25	Álvaro Seiça:	Yes, the problems are huge, but the potential is also huge!
00:47:38	Álvaro Seiça:	Thanks @Jeremy
00:49:03	Álvaro Seiça:	Thanks also Jason and Samara for the inspiring talks
00:53:39	Mark Marino:	Jeremy can talk abt ur thoughts on preserving ipad apps
01:00:45	Rob Wittig:	I have a question
01:01:13	Jessica Pressman:	Love that metaphor of genetic material and ecosystem. Thanks for that, Jeremy— and Jeremy’s student
01:02:51	Jessica Pressman:	Rob brings up a great point about the desires of scholars, often over artists, as needing the archives.. and what is desired for the archives.
01:08:08	Jeremy Douglass:	Jess, she is Elizabeth Callaway -- I tripped a moment on forgetting her professional last name status. http://www.elizabethcallaway.net/. Check out Eden’s Endemics: Narratives of Biodiversity on Earth and Beyond. https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5402
01:10:20	Jessica Pressman:	@Jeremy: Thanks!
01:14:53	Mark Marino:	exactly
01:16:06	Mark Marino:	i also wrote an ipod fiction that exists on one device
01:16:37	Mark Marino:	right!
01:17:15	Mark Marino:	wow
01:17:54	Rob Wittig:	Thanks, Jess. Yes, so much of seemingly monolithic canons is actually the result of quirky “stans” / superfans / collectors / hobbyists with what we would consider non-scholarly motives, who love things and want to preserve them. We owe such a debt of gratitude to all these wonderful characters in the past.
01:19:20	Jeremy Douglass:	@Rob -- agreed -- the past, *and* in the present! Superfans do a serious amount of heavily lifting in realtime public curation....
01:20:49	Jessica Pressman:	@Rob Exactly. “The Archive” is not always something planned. And collecting, hoarding, loving things matters to this effort
01:20:50	Jeremy Douglass:	Samara's "meant to disrupt" evokes larp- ostranenie / larp-defamiliarization for me.
01:22:05	Mark Marino:	applause
