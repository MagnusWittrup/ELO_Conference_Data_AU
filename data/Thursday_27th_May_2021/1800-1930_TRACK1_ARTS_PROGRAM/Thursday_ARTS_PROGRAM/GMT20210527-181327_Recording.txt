00:38:22	Deena Larsen:	Hooray committee!
00:39:06	Deena Larsen:	The ghost in the rooms...
00:39:13	Leonardo Flores:	He might come up the pipe behind you.
00:39:18	Lai-Tze Fan:	^ Hahahaha
00:39:27	Katie Schaag:	Does that count as one of the technical difficulties you’ve been wanting? ;)
00:39:47	Deena Larsen:	IRL Tech
00:41:46	Mark Marino:	i enjoyed it
00:42:00	Laura Z:	Hi! I can’t unmute right now (with kids), but I LOVED the walk poetry yesterday!
00:42:12	Roberta Iadevaia:	it was beautiful and inspirational
00:42:14	Mark Marino:	rob and i have been trying to get people out walking
00:42:32	Mark Marino:	i enjoyed the chance to be out walking with others
00:42:35	Katie Schaag:	Ooooh I love that!
00:42:47	Katie Schaag:	Would have loved to participate but don’t have data on my phone :’(
00:42:58	Mark Marino:	it also reminded me of "it was Dark by then"
00:43:12	Mark Marino:	and "Moody Locales"
00:43:16	Malthe Stavning Erslev:	On the topic of chat poetry, there is the Aarhus Urban Operating Systemhttps://aauos.online/
00:43:24	Sara Raffel:	I enjoyed the feeling of “walking” in other locations and time zones
00:43:25	Roberta Iadevaia:	perfect for me
00:43:29	Mark Marino:	Good pace, 300 steps I had to cut short
00:43:52	Mark Marino:	i am fond of networked improvisation
00:43:58	Mark Marino:	did not need prep
00:44:05	Laura Z:	I loved feeling my neighborhood transform through the shared experience, and to feel this place that I’m in every day suddenly connected with other places/dialogues around the world…
00:44:06	Ian Hatcher:	It felt fast but I liked that it felt fast- it had a calm urgency
00:44:18	Mark Marino:	would've worn different shoes
00:44:30	Deena Larsen:	Calm urgency is that like urgent peace
00:44:46	Mark Marino:	it was really enjoyable, like walking guided meditation
00:45:04	Laura Z:	I loved the spontaneous quality… no prep.  :-)
00:45:35	Mark Marino:	might be nice to have some prompts where we would respond to each other's posts
00:46:12	Deena Larsen:	I unfortunately missed the performance as my network cut out at the wrong moment. Could someone provide the URL for DAria's work
00:46:16	Mark Marino:	like passing a flower to someone
00:46:17	Rob Wittig:	Fantastic project!
00:46:26	Mark Marino:	Great work!
00:46:27	Katie Schaag:	Yes URL plz!
