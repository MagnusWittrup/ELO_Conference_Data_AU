117
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.030
Ian Hatcher: let's see if this works.

118
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.490
Deena Larsen: People seeing rainbow glasses.

119
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:21.330
Katie Schaag: Yes.

120
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.430
Deena Larsen: Yes, okay lovely.

121
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:35.580
Deena Larsen: And shout out to Kevin o'brien, who is here, and the Georgia tech students and my deep apologies, I only have 10 minutes, and we do have a prototype.

122
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:45.870
Deena Larsen: But it didn't quite fit I wasn't quite confident of it, so this will not be in the exhibit, but we will get there, eventually.

123
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.920
Deena Larsen: This is chronic my personal xanadu.

124
00:16:51.120 --> 00:17:17.340
Deena Larsen: And it is written in both English simple version chronic and rose the complex reading here is a see surprise unexpectedness the age of joy and sorrow intermingled with the painful memories, on top of the good ones oh positive intersecting the end of highest truth.

125
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:26.730
Deena Larsen: shattered by my love and I in time together the see again unconventional.

126
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:28.950
Deena Larsen: This is chronic.

127
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:41.790
Deena Larsen: It is written somewhat in rose language about 10 to 20 50% and in grows every letter in the Roman alphabet has a particular meaning a surprise to it.

128
00:17:42.270 --> 00:18:05.640
Deena Larsen: And every one of those has two to 16 different symbols that you can use to describe a variation on that so D, for example, is middle or close or far oh good or bad and I developed this language as a code, when I was in high school, so no one could read my journal, and my dear love.

129
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:14.790
Deena Larsen: She wanted me to publish it so i'm still trying, I promise that sometime I will get this.

130
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:26.790
Deena Larsen: Margie Larson What a wonderful woman anyway, this is a memoir and 193 written handwritten pages Julian jewels channeling has helped me.

131
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:36.360
Deena Larsen: Marjorie LUSA brink and stephanie told me to write it and honestly you guys I am it's just taking me a lot longer than we thought it would and.

132
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:49.380
Deena Larsen: Then you can click on any of the handwritten pages to see the art, so I bought that we would go through one of them, which is 125 I think i'm Ted Nelson.

133
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:56.370
Deena Larsen: And we have a prototype yay that rotates the page it's insane it seems out and it selects.

134
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:05.040
Deena Larsen: So you can click on any of these links and we're texting shimmer and you can click on them.

135
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.400
Deena Larsen: This one no then becomes right side up.

136
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:31.620
Deena Larsen: For those of you with paper quarters, I am Ted Nelson to the first words I ever heard him speak in 1993 but there's also a shadow of rows and I wanted to read that complex forge to use the F finite touchy grinning but that he well time out of time.

137
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:41.130
Deena Larsen: To the O positive em a gentle energy, but you not understanding the word this forget also T.

138
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.230
Deena Larsen: impossible.

139
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:59.880
Deena Larsen: Of or or have good memories with joy and sorrow tape ilan pass coming into the end of deception recorders reporters the T possible but the p angry.

140
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:16.800
Deena Larsen: And i'm just going to read this you do have in the real one, a way to read, simple and complex and to tell you how long i've been working on this, I recorded all of the simple and complex in South Africa in 2016.

141
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.720
Deena Larsen: we're working on it.

142
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:38.340
Deena Larsen: I first met Ted Nelson at the 1993 acm hypertext Conference in Seattle, I can't remember that he passed, the topic we were fiercely debating but Ted Nelson strode into the room and let us know who he was before he gave his piece the p of anger.

143
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:56.550
Deena Larsen: I quoted from literary machines in my thesis sharing in his dream of text context that could be so much more than a string of words on a page rage or later, a string bring of words worlds on a screen, one after the other.

144
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:12.000
Deena Larsen: Since my first encounter with Ted i'd heard him speak, perhaps a dozen times I hear hear heart and T impossible is paying P of anger that we, the he.

145
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:25.590
Deena Larsen: If, then, a long time ago, could the D of distance have done so much, we could have recharge recharge changed the way humanity thinks reacts and.

146
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.330
Deena Larsen: We didn't.

147
00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:38.790
Deena Larsen: i've always been intrigued by types ideas so at the trace conference in 2004 I went up to ted's latest venture after his talk as well.

148
00:21:39.450 --> 00:22:00.780
Deena Larsen: This works well w of strength here ah of joy, but this breaks are painful memories leaks K oh give up already so change here sadness and if you did this, you could get this but see how much this piece doesn't mesh year now, our actual talk with some much more technical.

149
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:09.390
Deena Larsen: But night in Nottingham Ted and I stayed close closeted to his computer figuring out the ankles.

150
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:22.500
Deena Larsen: Now Ted records and videos every moment movement T possible and impossible have a finite his life and his has faults faults of these past notes.

151
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:42.330
Deena Larsen: It is a one to T impossible one mapping and I don't T impossible know if anyone will aspire spend and spire higher their time their life time em too much energy going through so.

152
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:57.390
Deena Larsen: He asked about materials and took a picture and video I told him about my decision process developed for my government job where teams figure out needs options and resources and arrive at mutually agreeable plans of actions.

153
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:15.750
Deena Larsen: So tech gets me in his car care to me to software development team that night at a more in the others and we spend the entire night um it's notes and broken coffee makers of pizza crust and hardware and machines and his team comes up with an entire new plan planet.

154
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:24.120
Deena Larsen: tennis impressed him stressed with how his plan comes together and tells me to go into business with my decision making consulting.

155
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:36.930
Deena Larsen: yeah I decided to follow ted's T impossible he time out of time D so damn distant nelson's advice.

156
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:52.980
Deena Larsen: So I wanted to business so change selling telling the G fat my decision process to a wide variety of businesses, my business model model failed utterly muttered.

157
00:23:53.790 --> 00:24:14.070
Deena Larsen: I am not a good salesperson P of anger I rebel reveal in ideas ideals, not in dollars, and I could not get she said he time out of time to impossible, the hang of the profits and loss, so I lost my savings, savings as well.

158
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:39.030
Deena Larsen: Now the irony, the why so deeply vulnerable of following ted's advice life has never left me ideas before their time be at Zanna do D so distant and you so in comprehensible or rational rationale decision making are never profitable and I can only imagine the bitterness.

159
00:24:40.080 --> 00:25:00.120
Deena Larsen: The order oh so negative a her painful memories D close yet so far he time well out of normal time are again so painful to remind us of magnitude magnificence bitterness, the S of change.

160
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:02.760
Deena Larsen: The Ted must feel.

161
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.840
Deena Larsen: So that's my little vignette about chronic and chronic has started um.

162
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:19.170
Deena Larsen: We have the working prototype I really need a bit more help to make this a real reality we've gone so far we've done more progresses here.

163
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:32.430
Deena Larsen: Then we have in 13 years oh my God i'm so we're past the abandoned where we're basically into the vaporware yeah we could make this work where and we're into the github.

164
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:40.650
Deena Larsen: Development where i'm which has helped a lot and the people who have made this possible are Georgia tech.

165
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:53.790
Deena Larsen: A print screen this so that you get katie shags email because she can help you get a Georgia tech application for your own work, but justin abundant and.

166
00:25:54.540 --> 00:26:04.170
Deena Larsen: Hassan, and he provided Mitchell and Kevin have worked so hard this year in getting me something I don't dare show because does break a bit and.

167
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.880
Deena Larsen: You know I don't know if we have any time for questions or if i've gone over my time.

168
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.120
Ian Hatcher: We have a little bit of time.

169
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.010
Ian Hatcher: If anyone little bit.

170
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.420
Deena Larsen: But we have a question yeah let me know.

171
00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:24.810
Deena Larsen: And also, many of you have had have had we had right there their names in rose language, if you email me.

172
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:33.900
Deena Larsen: We can do that, we have a Bot that doesn't quite work that will also translate things into roads and.

173
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:40.320
Deena Larsen: i'm not i'm not looking all the way down to come at the chat sorry.

174
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:47.160
Deena Larsen: Yes, it was incredible that the GT students were able to help me with this amazing presence.

175
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.380
Deena Larsen: And katie has her email in the chat and.

176
00:26:53.430 --> 00:27:06.510
Deena Larsen: Again, I do want to say this book is huge part of the issue is, you know have somebody who's willing to work for what I can barely pay them on a government salary I my hands don't work well, so I do need help.

177
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:14.280
Deena Larsen: Getting all of these into svg code it's going to be out to the 400 hours worth of work.

178
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:24.600
Deena Larsen: So, yes we're not quite at the full realization yet katie, but we are so much closer Thank you Kevin, who is here yay.

Deena Larsen: I guess i'll end with that Thank you.

181
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.700
Deena Larsen: yeah never be a pioneer it's too painful.

182
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.080
Deena Larsen: I can stop sharing my screen, I think I had this problem last time.

183
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.500
Deena Larsen: Hope you guys were able to see my screen.

193
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:16.890
Ian Hatcher: I mean it.

194
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.540
Ian Hatcher: It opens up a lot of layers.

195
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:32.580
Deena Larsen: yeah it's kind of fun, because it is paper, there will be a paper version someday um and it's online and we're hoping for a phone version as well again email me if or.

Deena Larsen: i'll put it in the chat.

198

Ian Hatcher: All right, thank you again Tina and.

199
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:53.550
Ian Hatcher: I lay I look forward to seeing then realized next up on our program we have another beloved figure we have David Java Johnston job very ready.

200
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:04.200
Ian Hatcher: This would be the platform this embodied 20 years of clear.ca yeah i'm I visible, am I audible.

201
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:13.290
Ian Hatcher: You are Thank you dina that was so beautiful and to darien and Chris like anyway.

202
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.520
david jhave johnston: So I have no idea about how to do performances on zoom.

203
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:27.990
david jhave johnston: i'm going to share with everyone a Doc in which they can put their chat comment because I find the same thing as Alan those little chat comments that appear over the screen.

204
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:38.130
david jhave johnston: While i'm working they just be bothersome so please have a conversation i'll be partially watching that document, if you don't have that extra screen well I guess it's a problem.

205
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.980
david jhave johnston: i'm going to do a quick share screen and hopefully.

206
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:58.350
david jhave johnston: This will all be audible and now I can't see anything right because i've got a single screen so in you're going to tell me if this is going to happen because it's happening.

207
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.270
Ian Hatcher: it's happening.

208
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.130
And is it audible.

209
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.320
david jhave johnston: Are we listening to organic website design and no propaganda pesticides or ideological toxins.

210
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.000
Ian Hatcher: We are.

211
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:21.630
david jhave johnston: This is not nice so that was 1999 Have we gone anywhere like have we changed as we've moved from these user configurable open apparatuses imagine the joy.

212
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:31.440
david jhave johnston: of arriving in a place where suddenly you could get words to visibly move, and then the depression that occurs in 2021 when you discover that you.

213
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:45.960
david jhave johnston: The corporation which sold you the software after you bought a cracked you had a cracked version you bought the software and then they stop a potentially unsafe operation, it feels nasty but let's have a look at this unsafe world.

214
00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:02.040
david jhave johnston: This is January 2001, this is the young carpenter working on like this open space of making things move around in strange ways and enjoying the way the waves open up.

215
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:12.060
david jhave johnston: Awareness begins outside us and enters to die everything outside begins with enough within this there is nothing, nothing begins nowhere here begins now.

216
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:24.780
david jhave johnston: The structure of this dawn decaying nebula I have perfectly morbid irrelevant compassionate virtual violence is somehow hoarding everything within the interface.

217
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:34.980
david jhave johnston: And these interfaces themselves, full of large 832 files and images to alternate 98 files and MP3 is dead doesn't work anymore.

218
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:47.040
david jhave johnston: So the way I feel about the platform and the pandemic, the whole movement toward the infinite scroll is we've become enamored by the goddamn fucking weeds of corporate control.

219
00:31:47.460 --> 00:32:04.020
david jhave johnston: And that sort of stuff is sprouting over us everywhere there's no way we can explore anymore we're morose and jubilant as we helplessly and hopelessly tried, with a being killed by the corporation somewhere.

220
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:14.640
david jhave johnston: And this is why recursion is important, why the glistening apparatus a built in code that you do yourself can be so helpful.

221
00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:33.690
david jhave johnston: And that puts us into an interested your region it's somewhere between the life and death portion and almost uttered in dissipation place where timelessness and time enter into a drinking state a place where we'd seen from as many angles, as subjectivity will allow and this.

222
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.310
david jhave johnston: And then, in that resolute silence the proceeds discovery perfection is born itself dies.

223
00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.060
david jhave johnston: it's something I can't really speak of.

224
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.500
david jhave johnston: Something just done without me within me.

225
00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.710
david jhave johnston: And I lack in this first embodied moment the neuronal capacity to comprehend.

226
00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:17.910
david jhave johnston: Within this hijack brain of the platform of the body on calibrated sensors plasticity will be necessary identity congealed or in continuity def does not exist life oscillate it forms and team desire takes time.

227
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:28.230
david jhave johnston: And in this we can maybe understand that all code is going to die, all of the bodies code is an old.

228
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:44.550
david jhave johnston: And somehow in the super abundance of life, things have lost their knowledge of things, and now is it's lost its lost in a warm wet future a profound and illusionary.

229
00:33:45.330 --> 00:34:00.630
david jhave johnston: succulent wild language which is both a thing, and not a thing it's not a deed it's not dead it's somehow indeed in between words and action.

230
00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:16.830
david jhave johnston: it's now here in the debris rolling along the generous infinite passage between virtual platforms, where the blend this of propaganda and mental debris blow everywhere.

231
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.130
david jhave johnston: The hierarchies sprout.

232
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.360
david jhave johnston: animosity takes root.

233
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.990
david jhave johnston: The scene polarizes.

234
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:48.330
david jhave johnston: So it becomes what you feel and feels what you become nice luminous lush accidents line up to become you memories ash interpretations fire, what are we attached to careening reservoirs of molecules.

235
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:59.790
david jhave johnston: nucleus mucus strands cleaving like exit ropes clinging to the paper clinging to the certainty of an easy interface.

236
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.620
david jhave johnston: Even as the lump that kills us that kills and clarifies the light of embodied form.

237
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:15.990
david jhave johnston: The hand and the heat all of the heart of the hair and the skin and breath of love the smell of light.

238
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:33.780
david jhave johnston: The love that we share in knots the juice that fevers the eaten the merging and arriving all of it is playing as we learn in blind holding and seeking all of it is itching all of it is DNA junk.

239
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:48.270
david jhave johnston: Space crowds emptiness power accelerating discourse machines that immaculate recursive interested you'll singing, this is an implacable paradox future of flexible pandemic platform and it's an adopter.

240
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:57.570
david jhave johnston: With solutions so matt space inside the social media feel a little bit paranoid, you know.

241
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:05.190
david jhave johnston: You get your camera check me how you you regarding what i'm typing my heart rate my dope domain right you got it all worked out.

242
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:17.880
david jhave johnston: To have you in your voyeuristic malignant curiosity, I want to buy that thing do I want to buy that thing going to click that baby i'm going to put an end to it i'm going to delete all my accounts you don't believe you will Fuck you here it's done it's done hold on.

243
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:19.620
hold on.

244
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.490
david jhave johnston: I feel better.

245
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.200
david jhave johnston: i'm not anywhere here i'm with the pollen in the air.

246
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.460
david jhave johnston: i'm glad you didn't think I could do it.

247
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:48.570
david jhave johnston: What does not change is the will to change what does change is the capacity to change the past the beat threshold, what we see on the screen has changed our capacity to change it has changed.

248
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:58.710
david jhave johnston: just become gear earth the Earth is offline they are there is offline and into the purity of its forms.

249
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:06.960
david jhave johnston: Along the rigorous provocations slouching like a sacrifice technicals dream.

250
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:26.850
david jhave johnston: And trillions of galaxies endless cells infinite infinity life is redundant reboot the universe now exponential increase information hemorrhaging you cannot keep up every time you click you hurt reboot the universe now.

251
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:52.710
david jhave johnston: temporal mental compressing time and ratio of one to 1000 irrelevant moments obscured by seeming relevance effort in bent over backwards, the trees are only tiny sprouts the sky appeal spore boredom begins here universal redundancy made more redundant summer in full serene fury.

252
00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:08.010
david jhave johnston: I build a monument to a dead cow put a photo of it on the plane flew the paint on the Pole and then we enter into the midst transcriptions of survival traction elite from air into species interspecies.

253
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:17.610
david jhave johnston: disconnected fragments of thoughts that scrutinize discourse like fragile seem strange to the shimmering light, we try to pick it up.

254
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:26.700
david jhave johnston: We reach down into the exhaust fumes and find a slip of paper on which is written, the history of earth as told by a star that has never had planets of its own.

255
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:43.290
david jhave johnston: And the following installation has been approved for durable audiences that the corporate branch of your identities core terrible tethered sports seeking threshold uncivilized audiences stern radek dream debris dense emptiness that level to provoke vertigo.

256
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:51.780
david jhave johnston: Following review has been approved for listed audiences synthetic life neglected desk do not attempt this in your own home.

257
00:38:52.770 --> 00:39:05.940
david jhave johnston: You initialize fog your your life file is almost complete you reserve zero as one your mind is when you're certain morbid devout locked pure devout closed resilient frenetic undecided in different observed.

258
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:11.520
david jhave johnston: skulls and smiles dichotomies of.

259
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.460
david jhave johnston: Your life is war and war and death.

260
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:26.730
david jhave johnston: death is like a log wiki to which you have not yet found.

261
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:39.510
david jhave johnston: Why isn't why isn't why isn't Why is it, why is it, why is it.

262
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:47.250
david jhave johnston: So if we can understand whoa we skip that one, and if we can feel more.

263
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.460
david jhave johnston: We might feel the word congealed for two.

264
00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:57.000
david jhave johnston: and eventually we might know that grace is arbitrary just an energy.

265
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:18.810
david jhave johnston: and fears or rivers just energies excitement even is monotony all that dopamine and serotonin being provoked it's just a storm somewhere over the tracks and even the tumors inside us generous complicit civilizations.

266
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.840
david jhave johnston: And truth ah let's look at that sack full of tongues paralyzed.

267
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.300
david jhave johnston: What is a human.

268
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:42.450
david jhave johnston: palpitating bulging breathing shaking shivering it's a machine it's a machine made for making more machines it's maybe a mind of your mind that's apparently scarred.

269
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:52.110
david jhave johnston: A mind apparently scarred by other minds it's not intriguing how the metaphor works, how the metaphor is a meat core team rope.
