		The reason I mentioned this is not because we are stuck in the past, but I want to stress how important it was for the participants to meet.

		We were around 200 participants and one of the participants I remember traveled all the way from Bulgaria by bus.

	CONTAINING:
		It was, in other words, a platform for artists and art who had to invest themselves in the maintenance of the infrastructures that kept them alive as a community.

	AFTER: 
		A lot of work went into the run me dot org repository, and it's still online, and you can go visit a curated collection of net and software artwork's browser, add code art, Perl poetry and more.

		Each work was accompanied by a curatorial statement, a qualification of the work by the people in the community at the time.

	CONTAINING:
		The dog marked an important moment in time and also became the topic of Olgas early academic work on art platforms.

	AFTER: 
		So at a conference on platforms and art and literature in a post Westenra platform pandemic pandemic, we necessarily believe that Olga has something to say and can help us set the key.

		Back then, in 2004, our platforms were interesting because they had developed a sophisticated way of making culture happen via routes that are unique to networked media and I'm quoting always work from back then, these routes and strategies that are unique to network media have changed significantly since then.

	AFTER: 
		The user has become something else and so has the folklore of digital culture and the strategies of counterculture.

		What I believe many of us find interesting or intriguing in all his academic work is her sensitivity to see the many and diverse cultural practices that have appeared in network culture and also in its platform ization.

	AFTER: 
		So when listening to Olga and and reading her work, I always learn about these very practices.

		And she always provides us with a compelling vocabulary to understand them, such as, for instance, new media idiocy or lurking or the digital subject, which I believe she will be telling us more about in a minute.


	SENTENCE INDEX 44
	BEFORE: 
		But if you have questions to all that you'd like us to bring up after the talk, please post them in the Q&A section.

		This makes everything much easier from our side.

	CONTAINING:
		And having said this, I also apologize on behalf of the platform Zoom's webinar, which doesn't allow you to access your camera or microphone, but really that is us here and almost will do our best to represent you and raise your questions.

	AFTER: 
		So please remember this Q&A in the Q&A section.

		And with this, I think I'll pass the word on to you.


	SENTENCE INDEX 80
	BEFORE: 
		But anyway, we have an anonymous attendee who asks, can you talk more about the precision of the data, the victors of being a digital subject and the anonymization?

		If you are just some data, then you are not cared about as a person.

	CONTAINING:
		And the next question is from someone who who has a as a panelist in the webinar, unfortunately cannot use the Q&A function as another platform restriction.

	AFTER: 
		So he's posted his question in the chat room and he asks, obviously, there's an algorithmic dimension.

		But apart from this, what is the difference between this distance you talk about and language as a system of distance and differentiation following post structuralism here?


	SENTENCE INDEX 114
	BEFORE: 
		I want to thank again the organizers for for my invitation and to say what a fantastic conference it has been that attended quite a few sessions.

		And it was always inspiring to see how close attention is paid to software, data and interaction infrastructures, how central art is to these investigations, and how political this work is, including the politics of memory, race, gender and multiple ontologies.

	CONTAINING:
		So I've seen other platforms mentioned and done Christian Wonderful introduced, and the work that that it came from is from the digital art of the 90s and my work in the field.

	AFTER: 
		And I was recently thinking that in two or three years, time will be celebrating 30 years of the World Wide Web.

		Right.


	SENTENCE INDEX 120
	BEFORE: 
		And just thinking about what changed and what happened from 1994 to 2020 for that is just ahead of us is mind blowing.

		So the World Wide Web transformed, you know, the world as we knew it and.

	CONTAINING:
		Now, when I'm teaching this period thinking ahead of this to this jubilee, my students often often say that's unthinkable for them, that there was a period of time when networks, platforms and technology would seem to be open to be discussed in terms of austerity to be developed and intervened upon as malleable as something is plastic that we could imagine infrastructure as something we could create and create with and in people socialized into the art practices of the late 90s maintain an ambivalent view of technology that is always with some kind of access, never fully to.

	AFTER: 
		And I hope to keep this sense even in today's talk, which she sounds quite gloomy, judging by the presentations of this conference, it is a powerful undercurrent, which is great to see.

		So I was a curator of this first software art festival.


	SENTENCE INDEX 126
	BEFORE: 
		Read me.

		The first edition took place in Moscow in 2002 and then in Helsinki 2003 in August with the wonderful team, enormous Christian and saw and then other people in Southern and form and endorsement in 2005.

	CONTAINING:
		We created a platform for software called Running, its idea was to capture RAAG outside of the art field, you know, the naive art of coders that didn't self identify the artists and to develop it, as well as build an alternative self-governing system to support a new art form which would abandon the mechanisms of exclusivity to the idea of winning and the principle of hierarchy.

	AFTER: 
		So we were really keen on getting away from artificial scarcity and developing a new system that we will work with.

		Funnily enough, from me became known as a platform for automated curation, although it never was a fully, automatically created system, although we did seem to develop a formal relationship with technological infrastructure that is collaborative.


	SENTENCE INDEX 128
	BEFORE: 
		So software at first started being discussed as an art form in the late 90s, and it emerged out of Nasdaq's attention to the materiality and politics of networks, a theme that is more than current today as part of my festival, inspired by the early work political commitments to self organization and self governance.

		We created a platform for software called Running, its idea was to capture RAAG outside of the art field, you know, the naive art of coders that didn't self identify the artists and to develop it, as well as build an alternative self-governing system to support a new art form which would abandon the mechanisms of exclusivity to the idea of winning and the principle of hierarchy.

	AFTER: 
		So Romney was done in 2003 when I was beginning to work on my PhD and I ended up writing about Ron reformulating the concept for this kind of work.

		The one of our platforms, our platforms and related work of organizational esthetics I wrote, produces or develops an art movement, an art form through my own home cooked mechanisms.

	AFTER: 
		So you probably picked up on this long introduction on three distinct things the question of platforms, data and software, the question of subjectivity and formulation of subjects, and the question of the relationship between platforms, subjectivity and esthetics.

		And today will be intertwined in my talk as I will be speaking on the question of data platforms and software.

	CONTAINING:
		And here we'll talk about the process of subject formation and subject evasion in relation to data and platforms.

	AFTER: 
		This is really a large theme.

		So I will only describe very briefly some routes that can be taken here, including the usefulness of specific schools of thought, understanding what I will call poetics of idealization and the esthetics of recognition.


	SENTENCE INDEX 191
	BEFORE: 
		But the way in which they make sense is always compound.

		The value isn't belonging to a group and they're called upon as groups are combined together.

	CONTAINING:
		And there is, as of recently, compatibility between categories and used by different platforms.

	AFTER: 
		So now Google and Facebook, for instance, are compatible.

		Individual data snippets are composed and categorical subjects that are based on data that lends itself to group formation, such as gender or interest.


	SENTENCE INDEX 275
	BEFORE: 
		It will be drawn from different sources as diverse as the census and consumer data, and combined it will.

		Huge is easy to see how this process is fabled and how we can see a certain politics of idealization of the work here.

	CONTAINING:
		We've seen how poor a specific character creation, the narrative, if you will, even the most banal and schematic, like a skeleton of a character, is part and parcel of data practices and platforms.

	AFTER: 
		So to go through it again.

		First, the ideal subject is created and a framework within which it acts in the way that is desired, then characteristics of those around through people's characteristics, which sort people into unique groups on the basis of their relation to the ideal subject's qualities.


	SENTENCE INDEX 349
	BEFORE: 
		You know, if you moved by them, it confirms and affirms that loves you wherever you are, even though maybe especially if your views align with those of white supremacism.

		The subject, for instance, in this specific tirade I'm thinking about a vote for Brexit is formed by this affirmation.

	CONTAINING:
		So with platform based data practices, what we have in operation is not only modlin and machine learning and various, as always, power mechanics, but also, you know, a kind of process which heavily draws upon politics of idealization and the esthetics of affirmation.

	AFTER: 
		And the question that I would like to end with is whether the weaponized uses of these forces that are esthetic and used to belong to art and literature are reversible, are vulnerable within how we can use them differently and whether and how this forces of our role should work in ways that are not destructive of the future, but a productive, wonderful difference.

		Thank you very much.


	SENTENCE INDEX 418
	BEFORE: 
		But in some way I noticed that.

		I thought I kind of started in the beginning.

	CONTAINING:
		This data practices and platforms hopefully will continue to fight each other, which is good for us.

	AFTER: 
		And there are also ways in which, through various political esthetic work, we could carve different spaces for survival.

		And so, I mean, I think art kind of.

		The first step for companies in this case is to create an ideal customer, a set of characteristics that are desirable for the business.

		And I apologize for this awful corporate imagery, but it often looks like this.

	CONTAINING:
		It is important to note that the kind and rule of identity of such a person, not in constructing digital subjects and how it is put right at the heart of all supposedly objective data manipulation.

	AFTER: 
		So it's even before you actually start getting data and doing something with it, you have to create this kind of ideal image against which all other protesters will be measured.

		So coming back to segmentation, there is machine learning models can be used for the purposes of segmentation.


	SENTENCE INDEX 262
	BEFORE: 
		So a few things are important here.

		The process checks in with the ideal profile iteratively at every stage.

	CONTAINING:
		And we can think about discrimination right here.

	AFTER: 
		If this clusters are not reachable or large enough or just an interesting commercial or politically, so they would be discounted when matched against this ideal profile.

		Secondly, and again, going back even criteria for segmentation another, I prioritize that based on existing knowledge is used as an element to deciding which information will be used for segmentation.


	SENTENCE INDEX 267
	BEFORE: 
		Secondly, and again, going back even criteria for segmentation another, I prioritize that based on existing knowledge is used as an element to deciding which information will be used for segmentation.

		And the way you have existing knowledge, you have bias always.

	CONTAINING:
		So this is profiling, right?

	AFTER: 
		So it's kind of understanding what's resulted.

		It is important to list all the steps and understand the logical operation, and I think I list them here.


	SENTENCE INDEX 348
	BEFORE: 
		Look at the slogans.

		You know, if you moved by them, it confirms and affirms that loves you wherever you are, even though maybe especially if your views align with those of white supremacism.

	CONTAINING:
		I truly think that what's Cambridge analytical scandal revealed in the apparent manipulation of voters and corruption of them into the right wing vote are the layers and processes that I am founded on, the process that I described of first digital, that subject abstraction, then passing those through the ideal voter, then personalizing the information, another set against another set of criteria for personhood, another abstraction, and then affirming the self that in the end go and vote, feeling energized by this multistory obstruction game.

	AFTER: 
		So with platform based data practices, what we have in operation is not only modlin and machine learning and various, as always, power mechanics, but also, you know, a kind of process which heavily draws upon politics of idealization and the esthetics of affirmation.

		And the question that I would like to end with is whether the weaponized uses of these forces that are esthetic and used to belong to art and literature are reversible, are vulnerable within how we can use them differently and whether and how this forces of our role should work in ways that are not destructive of the future, but a productive, wonderful difference.


	SENTENCE INDEX 481
	BEFORE: 
		But here we go.

		Yes, thanks, Alex.

	CONTAINING:
		So I'm in the middle of this project that I'm developing right now, and it's a surprise that I found myself in this in this terminology of subject and idea, and they even started looking at German idealism in trying to understand some of these processes and like a school school of thought that I would not associate myself with a normal year.

	AFTER: 
		So at the moment, I'm trying to think I don't have a full answer to your question, except that I would totally subscribe to, you know, the kind of movement of what humanity is, as described by Richard Doty and the kind of urgency with which we need to rethink and do things around climate damage.

		What I'm trying to do at the moment is to think how this continuation of subject abstractions that at the moment, at least to me, seem very much based on the content in the content subject, how and in what way they are ruptured and collective and in what way.

	BEFORE: 
		The first question is from Andrew Caboolture, and I'm going to read it aloud.

		And we are also going to post it in the chat.

	CONTAINING:
		Perhaps you could say something about how these data points are not ever interested in our reasoning or our rational practices.

	AFTER: 
		But like advertisement media, they are always categorized by desires and spontaneous interests.

		This categorization you mentioned is missing.


	SENTENCE INDEX 77
	BEFORE: 
		I don't know either.

		I think it is, but but I also think there's something around like if you look at at the start of the process of creation, which was an important part of me, all the sort of community curated artistic judgment, you could say, which is sort of significantly changed as you describe how esthetics works today and how taste is developed and how things are sort of propagated.

	CONTAINING:
		But anyway, we have an anonymous attendee who asks, can you talk more about the precision of the data, the victors of being a digital subject and the anonymization?

	CONTAINING:
		Or to put it in in in other ways, in what sense is data a kind of language?

	AFTER: 
		And if so, is it a language that we can learn to read and love?

		Yeah.


	SENTENCE INDEX 89
	BEFORE: 
		Thank you.

		I have a question here from Magnetized Carver who asks, I like how you refer to this as an omnivorous practice and with this complication of a subject as a category, I wonder if you could say more about who or what is eaten and by who and what and next how this metaphor works also for you in your thinking and analysis.

	CONTAINING:
		Jonathan Rogers asks regarding the very large topic of governmental regulation of data collection and analysis practices, I wonder where and how you might recommend the government of, let's say, Britain might begin.

	AFTER: 
		Yeah, times change, Alex sound, Pascale asks if we are ready to move away from the question of the modern subject as one based partly on ideas of digital abstraction abstractions, how do new paradigms that reposition humans within other organisms and the Earth and thinking about new materials and post humanism?

		How does this impact your understanding of the subject?

	CONTAINING:
		I think that's a very good answer, and then Kayleigh asked, the data is not raw as we know, it is always already a partial implicated transcription when put into a table.

	AFTER: 
		The columns and rows were, I guess, more or less agreed, categorical, categorical infrastructures.

		What for you to the generated machine learning dimensions represent?


	SENTENCE INDEX 99
	BEFORE: 
		Can they reveal currently hidden infrastructures of basically implicated, algorithmically privileged categorization?

		Thank you.

	CONTAINING:
		And he asks, I'm thinking of some of the engrosses work that leads to obfuscating data collection practices like the Grandal and add on for Facebook, which randomize is pre-fabricated responses.

	AFTER: 
		I'm sure many of the people in the audience are familiar with this work.

		So he asks, what strategies of resistance would you suggest?

	AFTER: 
		So Theron asked me to open with a little bit of going back to my previous work that saw in Christian talked about, and I'll do that for the first five minutes before kind of explaining how it brought me to what I will be talking about today.

		So I've seen other platforms mentioned and done Christian Wonderful introduced, and the work that that it came from is from the digital art of the 90s and my work in the field.

		And today will be intertwined in my talk as I will be speaking on the question of data platforms and software.

		It is now part of the common sense to stay that constant generation of data, analysis of data and prediction based on inferences from data as some of the key components of platform infrastructures which are organized to extract active and trade people's data.

	CONTAINING:
		And here we'll talk about the process of subject formation and subject evasion in relation to data and platforms.

	AFTER: 
		This is really a large theme.

		So I will only describe very briefly some routes that can be taken here, including the usefulness of specific schools of thought, understanding what I will call poetics of idealization and the esthetics of recognition.

		I apologize if you already heard this or read this so few years ago, quite a number of years ago, actually, my Ph.D. student who at the time was working in digital marketing, went to a lecture by a company that was coming into the UK market and the lecturer was explaining what kind of data they had access to and what kind of things they can do with this data to personal personalized advertisement and to target individuals and neighborhoods through this idea of digital zip's.

	AFTER: 
		So she was showing different kinds of data on the screen and at some point started discussing one specific point, like maybe that you would see here.

		The red dot in terms of the data that was available there and she was describing this individual that was probably a woman lived in on a specific south on the street, although this is not one of what organic vegetables wasn't on Twitter and, you know, London Underground.

		So the larger project that this talk is part of attempts to come to terms with this account and answer the questions, my astonishment at the appearance of Amy in such a chance encounter quickly gave way to disbelief that it was Amy.

	CONTAINING:
		The subjects are abstracted from social media data histories or browse or search engine queries, mobile phone positioning records, bank transactions, census data, facial recognition data, email inboxes, and innumerable other things.

	AFTER: 
		Dynamically updated and based on my data, they also based on other people's real or historical data, computational models and personal or collective assumptions, as well as a swathe of practices from computer engineering cultures to specific sector practices and larger social, political and political socio economic and political systems.

		I specifically don't use terms such as data and digital self or subjectivity to grant the notion of a subject that is made of and with data at some distance from us humans in data infrastructures.

	CONTAINING:
		It's a little bit boring, but advertisement is an area where you can actually study how data works and how to interpret it because a lot of other areas are being closed.

	AFTER:

		So let's look at how some of what I'm talking about actually, what are the subjects and how are they made and how I look like to Google about how we will use them.


	SENTENCE INDEX 183
	BEFORE: 
		And what are the kinds of things that are recorded as you act around on the Internet?

		You would visit, for instance, a store and be assigned a unique identifier that is matched with a specific product and an interest category.

	CONTAINING:
		A lot of free or basic web analytics tools will offer some crude data insights, drawing on my geographic data, the demographic data and engagement and interest data, the engagement, the Google determines my age and gender, among other things, by my name that I use in my Google email account.

	AFTER: 
		The engagement data based on data exchange between my device and the server and interest data would be another big analytic categories.

		My interest data is derived from my history of browsing entry and search terms into a search engine, watching videos and all purchase of travel information that can be gleaned from the content of my email and audio activity.


	SENTENCE INDEX 184
	BEFORE:

	AFTER: 
		My interest data is derived from my history of browsing entry and search terms into a search engine, watching videos and all purchase of travel information that can be gleaned from the content of my email and audio activity.

		At this stage, my digital subject is nothing more than unlimited data points.

	CONTAINING:
		So this data is categorized categorization, he refers to putting the pieces of data into groups or basic sorting, they are reportedly thousands of categories used in Google, not too many, actually, with free Google analytics.

	AFTER: 
		And there is, as of recently, compatibility between categories and used by different platforms.

		So now Google and Facebook, for instance, are compatible.

	CONTAINING:
		Individual data snippets are composed and categorical subjects that are based on data that lends itself to group formation, such as gender or interest.

	AFTER: 
		Categorical data and statistics is data that is not reportable as yes or no, but has a qualitative difference such as gender.

		But mattocks, as I can call categorical subject, all data cuts that are sorted into categories in contemporary data practices.

	AFTER: 
		And these are the simple forms of digital subjects.

		These are grouped subjects which are in effect cuts across categories, humans interests, interest, for instance.


	SENTENCE INDEX 205
	BEFORE: 
		But in this practice's, these categories are not based on normative values.

		These categories have nothing of classical core.

	CONTAINING:
		And so theologists often now talk about performance rather than representation in relation to this data practices.

	AFTER: 
		And you will see why in a minute.

		The kind of generalization produced by certain people into groups is well studied.


	SENTENCE INDEX 212
	BEFORE: 
		It is also the side of the crudest discrimination and discrimination has not gone away.

		But the process of its production changes as late the practices change.

	CONTAINING:
		It is also logically a method of sorting by establishing patterns and putting data points in groups across socio demographic, geographical psychographic and behavioral data in classical statistics.

	AFTER: 
		Methods of segmentation.

		Rely on a segmentation variable, which means the data input that defines what goes into which group, into which group, and the segmentation variable classical statistical method was, for instance, gender.


	SENTENCE INDEX 214
	BEFORE: 
		So after categorization come segmentation.

		It is also logically a method of sorting by establishing patterns and putting data points in groups across socio demographic, geographical psychographic and behavioral data in classical statistics.

	CONTAINING:
		Rely on a segmentation variable, which means the data input that defines what goes into which group, into which group, and the segmentation variable classical statistical method was, for instance, gender.

	AFTER: 
		And the rest was descriptive.

		The variables in data driven segmentation, they switched places.


	SENTENCE INDEX 216
	BEFORE: 
		Methods of segmentation.

		Rely on a segmentation variable, which means the data input that defines what goes into which group, into which group, and the segmentation variable classical statistical method was, for instance, gender.

	CONTAINING:
		The variables in data driven segmentation, they switched places.

	AFTER: 
		So the segment, the descriptive variable becomes the main driver that defines the constitutional segments and the rest of categories, including normative categories such as gender, age, act as descriptions.

		So you can see exactly how category it loses its normative and kind of restrictive restrictive function.


	SENTENCE INDEX 219
	BEFORE: 
		The variables in data driven segmentation, they switched places.

		So the segment, the descriptive variable becomes the main driver that defines the constitutional segments and the rest of categories, including normative categories such as gender, age, act as descriptions.

	CONTAINING:
		And basically now we have a certain fluidity that a lot of scholars write about that data during practice doesn't care whether you're a man or a woman today because you can be assigned to whatever suits this infrastructure for the next two weeks.

	AFTER: 
		You can be assigned the gender.

		So we're shifting into a completely different paradigm of normative chain of control than the one that the one that we know.


	SENTENCE INDEX 224
	BEFORE: 
		So we're shifting into a completely different paradigm of normative chain of control than the one that the one that we know.

		And this is an example from a text book that you can see in the upper part, the kind of first table you can see.

	CONTAINING:
		A segmentation variable in traditional statistics, which is gender, and then you have descriptor variables which are in this set of data, which is about travel and about why people travel what they like and traveling.

	AFTER: 
		Some people like to go to museums.

		They like culture.


	SENTENCE INDEX 229
	BEFORE: 
		They like culture.

		Some people like ective exploration of nature.

	CONTAINING:
		And in data driven or data rich practices, they literally score places.

	AFTER: 
		So here you can see in the bottom part, descriptor variable is gender.

		So it's the description and then segmentation variable, which is the the the basis of how things will be sorted.


	SENTENCE INDEX 233
	BEFORE: 
		So here you can see in the bottom part, descriptor variable is gender.

		So it's the description and then segmentation variable, which is the the the basis of how things will be sorted.

	CONTAINING:
		The presupposed homogeneity of the group produced through this remains, although it shifts its emphasis, but to go back a little even before this, the first step before the data exercises even begin.

	AFTER: 
		The first step for companies in this case is to create an ideal customer, a set of characteristics that are desirable for the business.

		And I apologize for this awful corporate imagery, but it often looks like this.


	SENTENCE INDEX 236
	BEFORE: 
		The presupposed homogeneity of the group produced through this remains, although it shifts its emphasis, but to go back a little even before this, the first step before the data exercises even begin.

		The first step for companies in this case is to create an ideal customer, a set of characteristics that are desirable for the business.

	CONTAINING:
		So, for instance, a furniture company would describe the ideal customer as a person who appreciates contemporary design, has with spending power, likes having people at home, like travellin ideal customer is often described as a persona, a character, a type, an ideal profiling against an ideal persona is that the foundation of data and analytical techniques.

	AFTER: 
		It is important to note that the kind and rule of identity of such a person, not in constructing digital subjects and how it is put right at the heart of all supposedly objective data manipulation.

		So it's even before you actually start getting data and doing something with it, you have to create this kind of ideal image against which all other protesters will be measured.


	SENTENCE INDEX 237
	BEFORE:

	AFTER: 
		So it's even before you actually start getting data and doing something with it, you have to create this kind of ideal image against which all other protesters will be measured.

		So coming back to segmentation, there is machine learning models can be used for the purposes of segmentation.


	SENTENCE INDEX 238
	BEFORE: 
		And I apologize for this awful corporate imagery, but it often looks like this.

		So, for instance, a furniture company would describe the ideal customer as a person who appreciates contemporary design, has with spending power, likes having people at home, like travellin ideal customer is often described as a persona, a character, a type, an ideal profiling against an ideal persona is that the foundation of data and analytical techniques.

	CONTAINING:

	AFTER: 
		So coming back to segmentation, there is machine learning models can be used for the purposes of segmentation.

		This will not only be based on multiple segmentation variables determined in relation to the ideal profile, but also on assumptions implied by the method of a specific machine learning model used.


	SENTENCE INDEX 252
	BEFORE: 
		Profiling is the next step in the process, which intends to find out more about the segments, for instance, age and gender of people in the group, their preferred styles, anything about them that can make it easier to target them in classical statistics.

		There was no profiling.

	CONTAINING:
		In this new practice's data driven rich data practices, the basis for certain people into groups can be anything.

	AFTER: 
		So basically we don't know anything else about these groups.

		And then then you find out who the people are in these groups and how they ended up being together logically as an operation.


	SENTENCE INDEX 270
	BEFORE: 
		So this is profiling, right?

		So it's kind of understanding what's resulted.

	CONTAINING:
		At which points to understand at which point the generation of ideal personas and ideal structures, concretization of cultural forms, libidinal and economic judgments, as well as personal judgments, sector knowledge, historical practices and the agency of computational models set up and guide the data analytical process in a way in which it becomes only ever partially a data crunching exercise.

	AFTER: 
		Data used is also likely to be historic.

		It will be drawn from different sources as diverse as the census and consumer data, and combined it will.


	SENTENCE INDEX 272
	BEFORE: 
		It is important to list all the steps and understand the logical operation, and I think I list them here.

		At which points to understand at which point the generation of ideal personas and ideal structures, concretization of cultural forms, libidinal and economic judgments, as well as personal judgments, sector knowledge, historical practices and the agency of computational models set up and guide the data analytical process in a way in which it becomes only ever partially a data crunching exercise.

	CONTAINING:
		It will be drawn from different sources as diverse as the census and consumer data, and combined it will.

	AFTER: 
		Huge is easy to see how this process is fabled and how we can see a certain politics of idealization of the work here.

		Because you have at every step you have a sudden creation of an ideal persona or a character, which is interesting to think in the context of electronic literature and then matching against that at every point of the way.


	SENTENCE INDEX 275
	BEFORE: 
		It will be drawn from different sources as diverse as the census and consumer data, and combined it will.

		Huge is easy to see how this process is fabled and how we can see a certain politics of idealization of the work here.

	CONTAINING:
		We've seen how poor a specific character creation, the narrative, if you will, even the most banal and schematic, like a skeleton of a character, is part and parcel of data practices and platforms.

	AFTER: 
		So to go through it again.

		First, the ideal subject is created and a framework within which it acts in the way that is desired, then characteristics of those around through people's characteristics, which sort people into unique groups on the basis of their relation to the ideal subject's qualities.


	SENTENCE INDEX 286
	BEFORE: 
		So the digital subjects here are set between ideal subjects of ideal profiles and multiple descriptions of individuals, actions and qualities, personas, a fictional representation of customers based on motivations, desires, mentality.

		But digital subjects are also somewhat ideal.

	CONTAINING:
		They also descriptions both before the data practices start inside it and after it yields results.

	AFTER: 
		And once it moves from categories to interests and basically into descriptions, into sensation, into sensemaking, it becomes a matter of esthetics, becomes much of literature and art more broadly and hopefully.

		So I want to talk a little bit about prediction here as well.


	SENTENCE INDEX 291
	BEFORE: 
		So I want to talk a little bit about prediction here as well.

		Segmentation assumes the form of a table where segments are columns and segmentation, variable roles that I've shown you.

	CONTAINING:
		They don't go away with new data practices.

	AFTER: 
		In fact, Edwin Mackenzie and his book Machine Learners describe machine learning as expanding the use of the table, the technique of seeking similarities and resemblances.

		Edwin McKinsey.


	SENTENCE INDEX 309
	BEFORE: 
		Here is the normative power of the category of the table as an epistemic space.

		When it is vectorized, elements of the table are reformulated to be expressed as variables and become dimensions plotted and the multidimensional vector space.

	CONTAINING:
		On the one hand, things become even more homogenized and what appears is the capacity to predict by following the vectors, and there is also a multidimensional attempt that comes to express a difference in kind where the kind of data, every kind of data becomes its own dimension, Mackenzie writes.

	AFTER: 
		The real stake in the factories and data is not speed, but a transformation and data practice.

		It makes working with data less like iterations of data structures like least fields, and they able and more like food in the pliable material.


	SENTENCE INDEX 310
	BEFORE: 
		When it is vectorized, elements of the table are reformulated to be expressed as variables and become dimensions plotted and the multidimensional vector space.

		So a qualitative difference between types of categories disappears.

	AFTER: 
		It makes working with data less like iterations of data structures like least fields, and they able and more like food in the pliable material.

		The vectorized marked multiplication, transposition and inversion of data creates a new vector with variations can be explored, observed graphs and varied in ways that go well beyond the statistical tests.

		You know, if you moved by them, it confirms and affirms that loves you wherever you are, even though maybe especially if your views align with those of white supremacism.

		The subject, for instance, in this specific tirade I'm thinking about a vote for Brexit is formed by this affirmation.

	CONTAINING:
		So with platform based data practices, what we have in operation is not only modlin and machine learning and various, as always, power mechanics, but also, you know, a kind of process which heavily draws upon politics of idealization and the esthetics of affirmation.

	AFTER: 
		And the question that I would like to end with is whether the weaponized uses of these forces that are esthetic and used to belong to art and literature are reversible, are vulnerable within how we can use them differently and whether and how this forces of our role should work in ways that are not destructive of the future, but a productive, wonderful difference.

		Thank you very much.


	SENTENCE INDEX 362
	BEFORE: 
		I think what is interesting in this process and what I'm trying to grapple with, and I think your question probably kind of touches on this, is that on the one hand, the process through which they agree to digital subjects is very.

		Rational in a way, in which it what I struggle with, it's almost Hegelian is the way it draws upon like a process of idealization that are mathematical and also somehow creative.

	CONTAINING:
		But at the same time, they are able to target and kind of deal with data and deal with the attributes and kinds of qualities of humans that are, as you say, non rational or belong entirely to the to the body or to emotion and to kind of capture the individual in that kind of way.

	AFTER: 
		And I think kind of the real world, the real power of these practices are.

		And what makes it so difficult is that they are big animals.

		And the reason kind of a dimension of human experience, they can't really try to to to describe to to to to make a number out of.

	CONTAINING:
		And we don't we kind of save it from from data.

	AFTER: 
		I think data can equally process mystical beliefs as well as, I don't know, the records of of which examples you passed.

		Yes, I actually haven't read this work yet, so I but a few people said I should look at this Panella.


	SENTENCE INDEX 368
	BEFORE: 
		And the reason kind of a dimension of human experience, they can't really try to to to describe to to to to make a number out of.

		So I would say that, yeah, there is a certain kind of moroseness to this and it's very hard to say, well, this is, you know, is secret.

	CONTAINING:
		I think data can equally process mystical beliefs as well as, I don't know, the records of of which examples you passed.

	AFTER: 
		Yes, I actually haven't read this work yet, so I but a few people said I should look at this Panella.

		I think there's a quiz.


	SENTENCE INDEX 381
	BEFORE: 
		No easy question, Christine.

		I just want to say that.

	CONTAINING:
		And that is a very common actually notion and contemporary theory with lots of books called Our Date to Selves, our data subjectivities.

	AFTER: 
		Would they all kind of.

		And I think once we actually see there's a distance between them, there are various processes that happen that's more politically productive because then you can say you can interfere in this process.


	SENTENCE INDEX 418
	BEFORE: 
		But in some way I noticed that.

		I thought I kind of started in the beginning.

	CONTAINING:
		This data practices and platforms hopefully will continue to fight each other, which is good for us.

	AFTER: 
		And there are also ways in which, through various political esthetic work, we could carve different spaces for survival.

		And so, I mean, I think art kind of.


	SENTENCE INDEX 427
	BEFORE: 
		I think that I think that.

		These days of practices have different focus.

	CONTAINING:
		The creation of this ideal person, and it's probably caught a lot of data practices, and I would imagine that's probably quite the same for like you could describe this in relation to drone software and how the decision is taken to kill someone on the basis of filtering through it in relation to this ideal version of a terrorist.

	AFTER: 
		So sometimes I was going to say that the person, the individual is never really of an interest because it's always a group that individual person is not doesn't have enough cash to to be of interest to these processes.

		So at some level, it's always a group subject.


	SENTENCE INDEX 431
	BEFORE: 
		So sometimes I was going to say that the person, the individual is never really of an interest because it's always a group that individual person is not doesn't have enough cash to to be of interest to these processes.

		So at some level, it's always a group subject.

	CONTAINING:
		But I think with anonymization and I think generally I mentioned this with the idea of distance, I think it's possible to hide so much of your data, a footprint that you never get kind of captured in any of these categories.

	AFTER: 
		And a lot of data that doesn't make sense or doesn't fit into categorization, doesn't fit into this systems because they would be missed.

		So you like.


	SENTENCE INDEX 432
	BEFORE: 
		So at some level, it's always a group subject.

		But then with other examples, such as the the the drone automated killing, of course, the process can be changed to target individuals or whoever happened to be around them.

	CONTAINING:
		And a lot of data that doesn't make sense or doesn't fit into categorization, doesn't fit into this systems because they would be missed.

	AFTER: 
		So you like.

		But I think what's important to understand in this process that I think our old kind of habit of holding on to the value of singular person would like focusing on this me that is defined and, you know, constant subjectivity from birth to death is really outdated.


	SENTENCE INDEX 437
	BEFORE: 
		But I think what's important to understand in this process that I think our old kind of habit of holding on to the value of singular person would like focusing on this me that is defined and, you know, constant subjectivity from birth to death is really outdated.

		I mean, a lot of theorists and philosophies, philosophies say that, you know, that we are kind of not really one.

	CONTAINING:
		So it's not really a question of whether your data is collected or not.

	AFTER: 
		Of course, you may try to to defend yourself, but if you think politically there's such a collective dimension to it, that maybe the response should also be more collective rather than kind of individual minimization, a collective anonymization, obfuscation, all kinds of things.

		Yeah.


	SENTENCE INDEX 464
	BEFORE: 
		In our kind of imaginative capacities in our life, and then if we take if we understand that this day to practices this, computational practices rely on reductive uses about what can be done if there are nondeductible, more more interesting, you know, forms of of this kind of abstracted, destructive creations that are around and that are possible.

		That is maybe something that could do something.

	CONTAINING:
		Well, I guess I'm using this metaphor to refer to this sense of, you know, total capture by data, that there is a sense that I think a lot of people kind of haven't shared the moment.

	AFTER: 
		I think for me, it's difficult because as soon as I think something, I also think a contradiction of that or, you know, multiple other things that make everything very complicated and.

		I think that's why it's probably difficult to provide a response and and humans are so slow with coming up to with coming up with critical responses, interventions, political intervention, legal, you know, legislation to address this institutional change, I think this kind of speed and the has has consequences.


	SENTENCE INDEX 494
	BEFORE: 
		But I will tell you what I find in the year.

		Yes, Christian, can you leave the question hanging here so I can respond to it step by step?

	CONTAINING:
		The the categories themselves can be multiple, but then what happens, for instance, that a lot of this data processing is not on the basis of data that exists and not on the basis of categories that are defined, but are based on, for instance, proxy data.

	AFTER: 
		So you actually don't have the data that you need.

		So you take other data to stand in for the data that you need.


	SENTENCE INDEX 495
	BEFORE: 
		Yes, Christian, can you leave the question hanging here so I can respond to it step by step?

		So, of course, there is inherent conceptual infrastructure of categories then.

	CONTAINING:
		So you actually don't have the data that you need.

	AFTER: 
		So you take other data to stand in for the data that you need.

		So and then another operation, especially in this advertisement field, would be something that's called look alike.


	SENTENCE INDEX 496
	BEFORE: 
		So, of course, there is inherent conceptual infrastructure of categories then.

		The the categories themselves can be multiple, but then what happens, for instance, that a lot of this data processing is not on the basis of data that exists and not on the basis of categories that are defined, but are based on, for instance, proxy data.

	CONTAINING:
		So you take other data to stand in for the data that you need.

	AFTER: 
		So and then another operation, especially in this advertisement field, would be something that's called look alike.

		So that's a message again, where you have your categories and you have your people sorted through them, and then you want to find people that might act like them, like the ones you have.


	SENTENCE INDEX 503
	BEFORE: 
		I mean, it is a little bit, of course, about existing categories.

		And as Adrian says, the categories, the tables, they don't go away.

	CONTAINING:
		So in looking like you would have people that are structured into the segments profile like I described, and then there would be models to look through, other sets of data to find people who are like this, people that you already have.

	AFTER: 
		And then what happens with these dimensions and the generated vectors is that then when you have these groups of people in these clusters and they're kind of moving along these vectors and they're moving along these dimensions, then the the kind of working with this data becomes about measuring the distance between these groups, measuring the kind of consistency of these kinds of developments, predicting where they would go and how they would, you know, diverge from each other or keep kind of going in the same way.

		A lot of this is based on the Bayesian statistics, some kind of bias work with preexisting.


	SENTENCE INDEX 504
	BEFORE: 
		And as Adrian says, the categories, the tables, they don't go away.

		The way of working with them changes.

	CONTAINING:
		And then what happens with these dimensions and the generated vectors is that then when you have these groups of people in these clusters and they're kind of moving along these vectors and they're moving along these dimensions, then the the kind of working with this data becomes about measuring the distance between these groups, measuring the kind of consistency of these kinds of developments, predicting where they would go and how they would, you know, diverge from each other or keep kind of going in the same way.

	AFTER: 
		A lot of this is based on the Bayesian statistics, some kind of bias work with preexisting.

		Experience, and that's a little bias comes in and discrimination, but.


	SENTENCE INDEX 523
	BEFORE: 
		And so if it's like a poor neighborhood.

		People would be denied loans or some kind of access to various things, and, of course, it discriminates against black people.

	CONTAINING:
		The point at which this this happens is historical data is that is used without kind of any critical interpretation or any desire to address the problem.

	AFTER: 
		Then it happens through sector practices, which historically used code for termination of insurance premium.

		Then there would be this use of proxy data and proxy practices entirely based on like your own decision making.


	SENTENCE INDEX 525
	BEFORE: 
		But the point is not that they're categorized and there's a category for these people and there would be too simple.

		The point at which this this happens is historical data is that is used without kind of any critical interpretation or any desire to address the problem.

	CONTAINING:
		Then there would be this use of proxy data and proxy practices entirely based on like your own decision making.

	AFTER: 
		So you would say we don't have the data.

		We can't measure how people know whether people are trustworthy or not.


	SENTENCE INDEX 526
	BEFORE: 
		The point at which this this happens is historical data is that is used without kind of any critical interpretation or any desire to address the problem.

		Then it happens through sector practices, which historically used code for termination of insurance premium.

	CONTAINING:
		So you would say we don't have the data.

	AFTER: 
		We can't measure how people know whether people are trustworthy or not.

		But we can measure other things so we can take what we can measure to stand in for this thing that we need, we need to decide on.


	SENTENCE INDEX 531
	BEFORE: 
		But we can measure other things so we can take what we can measure to stand in for this thing that we need, we need to decide on.

		And this is also very prevalent.

	CONTAINING:
		So you have like GDP is a proxy data for the economic well-being of a nation, which is a big problem.

	AFTER: 
		But it's like a practice of economics.

		So you have so it becomes so large that the infrastructure is not just data, the infrastructure is how insurance industry always used proxy data to do this.


	SENTENCE INDEX 533
	BEFORE: 
		And sometimes it's so habitually ingrained, sometimes it's agreed upon by a discipline.

		So you have like GDP is a proxy data for the economic well-being of a nation, which is a big problem.

	CONTAINING:
		So you have so it becomes so large that the infrastructure is not just data, the infrastructure is how insurance industry always used proxy data to do this.

	AFTER: 
		It's now just hidden within data.

		But it's in itself is not it's not new.


	SENTENCE INDEX 534
	BEFORE: 
		So you have like GDP is a proxy data for the economic well-being of a nation, which is a big problem.

		But it's like a practice of economics.

	CONTAINING:
		It's now just hidden within data.

	AFTER: 
		But it's in itself is not it's not new.

		It's more like IPE is coming from technology, but it's the same old thing.
